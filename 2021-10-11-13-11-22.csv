2,rEnOoWs3FuA,Grumpier Old Men - Trailer,"The more things change, the more they stay the same in Wabasha, Minnesota. The uncatchable fish named Catfish Hunter grows fatter. The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that's ""pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy"" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town's beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh. And stay tuned for the outtakes, including ""man-sized manicotti!"" ""Better, funnier and even grumpier than the original.""  - Joel Siegel, GOOD MORNING AMERICA/ABC-TV (c) 1995 Warner Bros.

The best movie for thugs))) . Mannnnn the best!! . Sadly I really didn't like this movie. The storytelling was so bad  I had no idea where things were going or who I should root for. It's just some random police investigation with a couple great action scenes... but that doesn't entertain me for almost 3 hours. . I saw the movie on the cinema and i have seen it many many times again since then . Do you know the music at the beginning of the trailer ? Pliz ^^ . GTA IV . Hollywood peaked hard with this movie.

In the extended version of The Town there is a scene where Affleck is watching Heat when his ex shows up. The Heat is the GOAT. . One of the best movies ever ! . Icons together! . Movie trailers were an event in the 90's. Trailers like this are why. . Brother you are going down . GTA V . GTA 5 copied this . imagine how people must've reacted seeing this in 1995 . The music at the end makes it feel like some romance adventure movie. . If Bruce Lee were alive .  . I can imagine a movie with two Hollywood legends in the same movie  .  . Clint Eastwood & Bruce Lee . Hate how they spoiled the restaurant scene in the trailer lol . I was born a while after this came out and only saw this great movie recently. Couldn't believe it came out 25 years ago when it feels like a modern crime thriller...this film has aged INCREDIBLY well. The trailer on the other hand...not so much LMAO.  Im sorry wtf even is this 1:23 . This is not just a movie...this is THE movie . Two things I really liked about this film ..One is their priority to their work &. Second how officer was loyal to his woman while in other side criminal left his woman when she decided to be with him. I felt bad for her. . I enjoyed overall. .  . Thank you team HEAT. . The greatest crime drama movie ever with legend casting 🔫🔫🔫👌👌👌👌👌 . The trailor narrator was the best thing of the 90s . I wish their was a Serious Remake of ""HEAT"".

My All time favorite movie wonderful superb great. Al Pacino. Robert di Niro. Valkilmer . Ein sehr schöner Film mit zwei Schauspielgiganten!! . Simply one of the finest films ever made by anybody. You can go 10 years or more without seeing it and put it on and think “holy fuck! They used to make movies this good.” For realz folks. It’s a good one. . BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!! . Now a quarter-century ago. Still an epic film  and it always will be. . Damn that last 15 seconds of the trailer shot goosebumps all through me - the music  the flash of brilliant actors  the epic voiceover. . 7:26 Am August 17th 2020 . I’m about to watch this movie for the first time . LEGEND v LEGEND in an El Classico Film!!! 💪🏿👌🏿✈️ . then there was Internet  CGI  Comics  Covid and... Nothing . The fucking font😂 . Martin Scorsese is best director ever in my opinion  anyone agree . Film was somehow disappointment. Especially heist scene was nonsense. Almost like Al Qaeda killing hundreds of people. . After watching this film again i didn't find it brilliant at all. There was useless unnecessary violence which always cut credibility of heist films. American film industry after that have gone even worse like examples like Ocean's Eleven shows. Film industry are presenting crooks like some kind of supermen. This is pathetic."

I was forced to watch this against my will . The worst adaptation of Mark Twain's novel 2 ever come 2 the big screen  Elijah Wood's performance as Huckleberry Finn was more believable than Brad Renfro's . Fuck Ms Cervi .

Um... he died in 2008... probably you didn't know about this  I guess? . WHAT?! he was like in his teens when this movie was made  and this movie was made in the 90's.  What happened? . of literature that is . I saw part of this movie  only a tiny amount.  And coincidentally I'm reading the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in my english class. . agreed . 0:54 Tom Sawyer got pwned!!!!! . it's painful to watch this trailer in general .  . Brad Renfro... I miss u :'( . Randy Taylor as Tom Sawyer? interesting.... . @ 0:22 Holy shit it's Laney Boggs! . I always had a thing for huck when i watched this movie. Ahh those damn drugs! RIP . @PanicSunday Yeah  just finished reading it and that's right on. Seems like Disney wanted to make Tom the loverboy type and Huck the rebel  when in reality they were a lot more a like and I'd say Tom was more of the mastermind. .

Is it me  or does this movie have a lot more killing and cursing then a regular disney movie . Cute movie. . But is it just me or should Huck & Tom 's personality switch cause how they act in this movie is nothing like they are in the book. I always see Tom as the one who is leader-like. .

Hey! i remember this LOL!  but i was too little to see it >.< . brad looks funny in this  i should see it! . @SuperMetalmania666 ahahhahahahahaha love it. . I was smart. I saw this movie before reading the actual books Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huck Finn. The movie didn't ruin the books  and i had the image of Brad Renfro in my mind rather than some country hick. Probably the reason why i enjoyed the books so much.  . The very beginning is funny too. . We saw this in English today. Huck is cute and fond of tripping Tom.  . @TmSwyer: Ok  thanks for the explanation. I've just read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer but I haven't seen any film based on the Twain's book. This trailer is the first time I see any ecranisation of his works  . @asmodeus585 Just completely personality wise.  Tom was no push over  Huck followed him as oppose to the other way around.  In this one they make Tom too adorable as opposed to his realistic  mischievous and romantic kid. . @TmSwyer: Do you mean their looks or the plot? 'Cause even in this trailer I see scenes that were descripted differently in the book. Becky would never hit Tom. . I read Adventures of Huck Finn and I'm in the middle of Tom Sawyer and I have to say  this trailer really makes them appear nothing like their book counter parts. . you have a point there. . See this one's where Huck's actually the right age.... Not like the Elijah Wood one  where he's like 10.... . Engine joe reminds me of tenzin from uncharted 2 . yes i know that  passed away is the nicer way of saying that. . No He ODed on Heroin after being relesed from prison. . brad renfro passed away . i miss the 90s . ohmygod  it's sooo upsetting to watch this and know that he's dead ): . He was truly good at what he accomplished though.  . Especially in this. (: .  . I had a HUGE crush on both of them when I was younger. aha . i agree..elijah wood was awesome . old skool!

I notice that this was quite prevalent some years ago - that the trailers actually reval the plot and all the unexpectes surprises. . ME ENCANTÓ . That voiceover ruins the whole thing. . 006 vs 007. Every the good bond won! 😁 ❤️ . Famous secret agent. That's an oxymoron if I've ever heard one. . It's still one of the best James Bond movies. . Vim pelo app Mega HD Filmes . the trailer makes it seem like a fast paced action movie but the actual movie is soooo damn slow and boring... I love the N64 game but the movie is SOOO DAMN boring and horrible pace... didn't age well at all . Goldeneye is my favorite Bond film. It's the coolest. . It is not right for women to be a King. Ireland  Scotland and english girls deserves better life. United States haves a far more better government principle and better King. Military world must rule men  Civic world women.  Paple  Karol Paple. . That is such a badass movie . Best bond film to date . Thank goodness I watched the film before watching any of the trailers. That Bond villain twist reveal in the trailer would’ve spoiled the movie for me if I watched it before the movie. I honestly did not see the twist coming when I first watched this film. Anyways  this is such a great movie. So far my favorite James Bond film. I never had the chance to watch it as a kid  despite playing the video game of it on the Nintendo 64 (but only the multiplayer  not the story mode) in my next-door neighbor’s house with him and my brother. I first watched this film last October on my computer for free. The first quarter of the movie (excluding the opening scene) admittedly drags  but the rest of the movie totally makes up for the sluggish pacing in the beginning. . This is and will always be THE James Bond. . A masterpiece! . This is so 90s. . Movie trailers were so shit back in the day. Today's are much better  strangely  the movies are much worse. . I didn't ask for your middle name Bond Bond . This movie is right after Licence To Kill. . This trailer shows just how unsophisticated they were in those days. No teasing about the villain's identity or the plot. They even provide a trimmed down version of the show-stopping dam stunt from the pre-title sequence that fails to convey what an amazing stunt it was. . ""You are like boys with toys"" . **cut to huge tank breaking through a concrete wall** .  . Ah yes these filmmakers knew exactly what they were doing . Was the explosion in Nashville on Christmas Day 2020 caused by an EMP? Walt Whiteman thinks so. https://waltwhitemansworld.blogspot.com/2020/12/some-awkward-questions-about-nashville.html . From the opening to Stargate (1995) VHS. . ""I AM INVINCIBLE!"" . très stupide film pour des cons! . James Bond  90s style! 😎 . oh wow they spoiled it  when I watched the movie I never knew the whole time so it was actually suprising. . The best Bond ever!!! My favorite action film. . The best bond film . Never took to Brosnan as Bond. Looked more like a concierge at a 5 star hotel than a deadly 00 agent.  Or a guy who could get you that Jaguar in the colour you wanted faster than other dealers.. . *Pierce Brosnan: **_The James Bond-iest James Bond Ever?!_* . Spoiler (without seeing the movie) - Sean bean dies.... . great . I was 14  discovering the flavours of life  unaware of the corruption and deceit outside cantonment zone  it came two years after the insurgency ended in Punjab and six years after the USSR collapsed (I read many of their works as a kid and as a teenager from classical writings to Cyberpunk)  it was the first 007 movie in a very long time  the first in my era of partial control over myself. I can watch it a 100 times. I don't even like UK or their crazy inhuman agencies. That was the era when I was really myself - indulge  free  athletic and a budding zealous bright individual. . Just love that little clip of music at 2:33 - encapsulates Bond. . Now its time to go get betrayed!! . And the most exciting parts were not even the violence! . 1:48 PM 12/8/2019  Did they do it for this one too?  I can relate to some scenes in this.  Just thinking to myself again is all.  My adoption family is Volga German (Russians migrating through Germany or Poland).  Kind of same drama with what 006 is going through being Russian in movie but working for British Govt.  007 is me NOW is how I relate to this movie.  I found out about the Royal House of Windsor. . 🍸 GOLDEN EYE 📡 Bronson best bond movie.👌 . Great Bond movie and great meta movie. . BMW Z3 ON FIRE! MY CAR! . It was a great comeback for Bond  and the best outing since 1981. And it gave us one of the greatest videogames of all time. . Still the best Bond film ever imo. . We say report . The dreaded circular run . Incell . funny how old trailers spoil all the movie but no one complained . This trailer itself just gave out the entire movie including the villain 006 which was suppose to be a twist in the movie. Huge spoiler! . Yo llegue acá por el video juego ._. . WTF a lot of fucking spoilers... . but not at all if you played the videogame :D . This trailer tells half the movie. :D . Not a big Bond fan  this movie is legit though. Pierce Brosnan was the right guy to play Bond  and Martin Campbell's directing is strong. Famke Janssen is the best looking thing ever seen in a James Bond film. The action is well done and it has a great 90's feel."

Rating: PG-13",PT2M50S,12358,18,2,0,1,Over the last four years  I have often thought about this movie - or watched it - when I wanted to remember what a President of the United States should be like. Those ideas have grown since the January 6 2021 riot and attempted coup at the Capitol.
12,a6lGULmQdb0,Balto Trailer,Balto 1,PT2M13S,1213416,2453,334,0,1045,"They could announce a balto reboot because balto 4 won't work but a balto reboot would work because i want to see a balto reboot and i hope they will announce it and when they would make a balto reboot they could make a cgi version of balto witch is 3d animated instead 2d and universal has illumination where they make alot of cgi animated movies and illumination could announce a balto reboot and put it on netflix so that the balto reboot will be a netflix original and i hope there will be a balto reboot soon . What did Steele do to Balto from 0:31 to 0:34? . This movie is wrong  Togo was wayyy braver and better . Is this a trailer or the whole movie 😂😂😂 . my childhood . I just did a project o n balto . I Like witl disney movies . Apollo sick . 20-02-2013. . I really like this Movie :) I already know this is based on a true story but That is actually my 3rd Favorite Movie Of all time . I subscribe!!!! . Wow  thanks for showing most of the movie universal . Ahh nostalgia. . Never saw this one but i saw the 2nd one . I love snow dogs of Alaska . I wish Balto and its sequels to be live action remakes like Disney movies. That would be cool. :) . I'm 35+ and watched this movie 20   years ago  I cried rivers when the movie ended  and I still cry when I think of this movie. . Togo's ghost after seeing this: ""Where the fuck's my movie!?!"" . Starring: the villain  the villain's sidekicks  the comic relief  and Russian Bob Hoskins . I wish this movie becomes a broadway musical and a live action remake. Just an idea. . This movie looks VAGUELY familiar.... . балто . I remember when I watched this move all the way til the end(Not even credits). It quickly then started playing Child's Play 3. This made this forcefully get out of my Baby Crib. However  I didn't know how to get out of my crib. But when sh*t happens. Anything's possible  especially when your panicking. I think the VHS tape was counterfeit. Yeah  my parents bought it at a swap-meet. It said with a custom sticker: . -Balto . -Childs play 3 . and thats it. . Hi I love that movie . I love that. Ovie I did not finish it becouse I  was in school so yeah😘🤗😇😘😗😘😰😟😩🙀😾😿😿👼 . I loved this movie. The sequels can suck it. . Yo this film is the best. . Didn't realize it was based on a true story.  No wonder it's a major tear jerker. . Easily one of the best movies of my child hood. . Very underrated movie. . this is the best fucking movie of all time . My favorite film of all time . I love this. . this came out two years before I was born. But I remember watching this when  I think  I was 4. I had and still have Balto 2 (my least favorite but I still like it). Every time I think of this trilogy I get them Balto feels. Especially with this one. My favorite moment in this entire series is when Jenna uses the broken glass so Balto can find his way home. And also when he gets back. . I have so many good memories from This movie when I was little 😭😭 . Balto is awesome  don't get me wrong  but there are a lot of dogs who participated in the serum run who hardly got any credit at all. Togo ran 91 miles (almost twice the distance Balto ran) and hardly anyone knows who he is. Balto is still an amazing story  but I wish all the dogs became as famous as him (Togo especially). . Balto you always be my favorite  you will always be close to my heart. Balto and Jenna will never die in my head  I hate you Toy Story. I am having serious doubts for a Blu-ray/20th anniversary editions (That features deleted scenes and more.) I will never forget you and neither the couples. R.I.P Amblimation! . Does it look like that pieces of music playing throughout the whole theatrical trailer to Balto (1995) are snippets of Joel McNeely's score to Iron Will (1994; directed by Charles Haid and starring Mackenzie Astin  Kevin Spacey  and David Ogden Stiers)? . Awwwww my childhood . At 1:15  that sounded like Tony Jay. . Can anyone please name the following music cues of Joel McNeely's score to the 1994 movie Iron Will that played throughout the Balto theatrical trailer? . Where did the music throughout the whole theatrical trailer to Balto? Is it original trailer production music or is it just Joel McNeely's score to the 1994 movie Iron Will? . This is one of the non-Disney movies I use to have on VHS  along with The Wizard of Oz  Matilda  Space Jam  Antz  and some other movies I can't really think of. . One of the best  yet underrated  animated movies of the 1990s and all time! Love ""Balto""! . ok my number 1 reason for going to NY was too see this statue  but now I read on wikipedia the whole story is a lie? like wtf? Ive wanted to go see it for 15+ years  but whats the point if its just pure bs .. ffs . 1:31 God Dammit why the hell would they create this jackass in this movie  I swear to god if I was a human character in this movie and was with balto at that scene where steele wouldn't let him take the medicine  I would use a gun I brought with me and shoot him in the body 6-12 times  and if he's still alive and bleeding on the ground I would use my hammer that I also brought with me and smash his fucking brains out until he doesn't move or breath  and finally I would saw off his head and take it home as a trophy. but still its a great movie . Today marks the 20th anniversary of Balto and I still can't believe the blu ray disc association still hasn't remade this movie in high definition. If they don't do exactly that  I am going to sue the company. LOL!!! . i remember this movie my cousin loves this movie baltos awesome . Taken from The Land Before Time 1996 VHS. . My Furry side just geeked out :-P . Since when is this movie 20yrs old? I remember seeing this in theaters..... . Memories. . Fun fact: Brendan Fraiser was originally going to be Steele. Also  this may have saved the studio if it hadn't been up against Toy Story. . Who the hell dislikes this??! 296 people should seriously check their perception... . I    love  that   movie . Rosie looks like Penny from Bolt. . Why is the grizzly bear black? lol . i loved that movie... . 0:51 . ... Did my ears just pick up the sound of a piece of the Jurassic Park soundtrack?? . Loved this movie 😭 . Ahhh my childhood movie <3 . ....... never heared of this only reson why is that i was born in 2000 :( but looks good .  . I ♡ Balto! ♡ . Haha. . This was my favourite movie when i was little. Honestly its still one of my favourites . best movie . Muk and Luk  the two polar bears were voiced by Phil Collins  who did the songs for two Disney animated features  Tarzan and Brother Bear. . Love this Movie!!!!!  . i nearly cried lookng back on this movie-my favourite childhood film. I must watch this again sometime . such a shame the film failed at the box office! . I remember this movie being darker than shown in this trailer... . R.I.P. Bob Hoskins. . Just an awesome movie!  . RIP Bob Hoskins/Boris . RIP Bob Hoskins . Or as I liked to call it when I was little ""bald toe"" . But why didn't the Balto on the cover look like the one in the movie? That's kinda strange. . Favourite childhood movie ♥ . I love and i mean LOVE this story i finally have 2 out of 3 of the videos.oh and the white wolf is baltos mom spoyaler alert :) . Great trailer for a good movie. I miss when the animated movies were promoted like this. . Some ppl think this movie was made by disney. It was made by universal studios. On a side note  great movie :D . It took me sometime to find this cartoon so happy! . Growing up with this and all dogs go to heaven huh guys :3 . I love this movie!!!!!! Is my fave movie!!!!!! . I remember this movie :) . 90's kids represent  . Attention all balto fans the movie is on iTunes GET IT NOW BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS AGAIN GET IT NOW BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS!!!!!!   . That shocking moment when you find out that Balto was actually a real dog that lived from 1919 to 1933 and that this movie was partially based on a true story. . this was and still remains my most favorite movie . im 18 haha i dont care i grew up with this movie. and i will still watch it to this day i will say with no shame i love this movie :D . super je crtani . saw it it is so good i am going to see two and three . i really want to see the movie i have been looking all over for the name i will  write back when i see it . Hmmm he reminds me of a certain lion... lol . i have the  movie on dvd and old kind . i wish they would make a balto 4 . this looks like something from disney! . why aren't there anymore movies like this being filmed! . Hello childhood."
13,dO2LWKpeyI8,NIXON Original Theatrical Trailer,"One of the best film trailers of all time, this was the original theatrical trailer for one of the greatest political dramas of all time, Oliver Stone's 1995 classic NIXON, starring Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen.",PT4M33S,262054,723,25,0,215,"Director's Cut version is the best  unfortunately Stone had to delete the Helms scene because helms made a Threat to sue Stone. . I visited President Nixon’s Presidential Library In 2008. It was a beautiful setting. In 1972 I was a McGovern supporter  but after visiting the library  I came away with new respect for President Nixon. . Wonder if a Trump film is in the works - many differences; yes Nixon ended the Vietnam war; overhauled many government agencies and created a few more like EPA and US Postal Service.  But Trump paralleled Nixon in meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-Un like Nixon's meeting with Chinese PRC chairman Mao Zedong as no previous US President would consider. . Anthony Hopkins was way more scarier as Nixon than he was as Hannibal Lector. . This  JFK  and Platoon = my fave Oliver Stone films. . i cant help but feel like if someone was to make a movie about trump as president it would be it would be way more dramatic and insane then this. . Nixon was the president of the United States. Of the United States. He was president of the United States. He was President. Of the United States. He was the president of the United States of America. Nixon was. Richard Nixon was the president of the United States of America. . Very similar to trump  . 1:28 *That's what he said.* . When epic movies had epic trailers. . God  it's so weird to think that this movie is technically a Disney film. And it was so controversial for the way it depicted Richard Nixon's life  that Walt Disney's daughter actually had to write a letter to The Nixon family  disapproving the movie. . I remember being in a mostly empty theater and seeing this trailer.At the 4:14 mark some guy across from me let out one of the biggest laughs I have ever heard in my life. . Still one of the best film trailers I’ve ever seen. . Love this movie ! Powers Boothe was great as Alexander Haig . . For Both Donald J Trump and Rodrigo Duterte Losing and Sacrificing Their Life  to World Spies Jerks Bastards Beauties...... . I love this film. A classic. Hopkins performance mesmerising. Simply one of the greatest political biopics of cinema history. Other viewers​ may disagree but Nixon is not simply portrayed as some kind of political bogeyman  there are variations of light and darkness here concerning Richard Nixon. As with any human being. That makes it a deep  thoughtful film. May I recommend Frost/Nixon as another excellent film. . This was one of Anthony Hopkins best performances. . I think Hopkins was a little miscast here. He never really gets the very characteristic voice patherns of Nixon  that deep growl. . Complete agreement with the summary of this videa . I don't believe that Pat Nixon ever raised her voice in her life. . Trump will get a movie like this xD . We all know Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor.  However his accent in this is TERRIBLE!!!  I hear too much of his British accent coming in and out.  I wish they would have used an American actor to play Nixon. . God bless Richard Nixon 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🐘🐘🐘🐘 . Im glad that i have this movie On Dvd  .. amazing movie  ❗ . i have been to Nixon museum   half of the visitors are from Mainland China.    Nixon was to us the Horatio  Alger of the late 1960's. . lol James Woods became his character in real life . What a Trailer  they don't make them like that anymore. . I wonder what kind of job Al Pacino might have done  playing Nixon as a kind of Mob Boss  which is what he basically was. Imagine Nixon as Tony Montana ..There doesn't have to be an exact physical resemblance  and the hint of Hannibal Lecter in the portrayal works well  but imo it is impossible to suspend disbelief that we are watching Nixon on the screen instead of Anthony Hopkins. His performance is all in the VOICE and makeup. It's like watching 2 hours of bad screen test. . OKAY  I'm not normally a fan of Oliver Stone but this one just blew me away after watched it using boxxy software. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn't that how life seems to be at times as well? . Why did they pick Anthony Hopkins to be Nixon  personly I think he doesn't look much like him at all. . Nixon was amazing. The elite wanted him out like JFK. He was a great American. . I'm binge watching ""The Post"" (2018)  ""All the President's Men"" . (1976) and ""Nixon"" (1995) at the moment.  A nostalgic trip down memory lane... . Nixon's worst mistake was to open China and give communism a gate for the 21st century. Other than that  leftists would be buried with old Soviet Union. The final speech is amazing! Great movie! . Do you really want this dick ? . Do you really want this dick? . That's one long trailer. But it looks like a good movie :-) . What a great performance .  by Hopkins!!!! . I watch this every night. Love the last line in the trailer. . Stone's best film  I reckon. Brilliant. . Amazing trailer for one of my all time favorite movies!!!! . I don/t like Oliver's tone. . Every goddamn awesome john williams'score reminds me to Star Wars . ""When they look at you  they see what they want to be. When they look at me  they see what they are."" That is a line you use to seal the deal with a trailer. . JR Ewing at 2:40 . Ah  the days before movie trailers had to fade/in out between every transition. . I didn't know Niles Crane served on the Nixon Administration staff. . Hannibal Lecter?  Aw  give me a fuckin' break  for god sakes. . I'm sorry  i can't get past the casting of Anthony Hopkins- he looks and sounds NOTHING like Nixon. . Great movie and I consider it Oliver Stone's best.  But why is the trailer 4.5 minutes? . This is one of my favorite movies as far as a pure entertainment value. But it wasn't very inaccurate in the sense that it basically portrayed him as a drunk. Even though people who knew him very well said he couldn't hold his liquor.  . This guy is a true idiot. Ignoring him might be the best thing one can do... . You pseudo-expert called Williams a ""plagiarist hack"". That alone tells me that you have no clue what you're talking or writing about. You pretend to have a clue about whatever you think it is  but you actually don't know shit. And again: it has nothing to do with hearing music differently. It has something to do with having a taste in music or not. And you pal  are missing that taste. There's no accounting for taste  because you don't have any. That's why we should end this ""conversation""... . You seem to be unable to understand what I was writing you in my previous comment. Don't know what's so hard about that. Anyway  you're still wrong about what you wrote. Has nothing to do with hearing  but rather something with understanding. And you definitely didn't understand a bit... . You neither have a good taste in music  nor do you have the clue what you're talking about in the first place. This track is called ""The 1960s: The Turbulent Years"" and is played when dramatic events during this period of time are shown in ""Nixon""  e.g. the assassination of Martin Luther King  the war in Vietnam and so on. You have no idea what you're talking about  idiot... . Dramatically inappropriate? It's an operatic score for an operatic film  and one of his most rousing works. It does wonders for the film. .  . Who is he plagiarising here? Support your libellous claims.  . Anthony Hopkins gives a superb performance as the sweaty unscrupulous Nixon. . Ironically  the bombing of Cambodia was actually the most serious of the charges and yet now is completely forgotten - presidents bomb without the country's approval as a matter of routine now. . lol  indeed. at 1:28 . I think this one is better than JFK . Frank Langella couldn't shine Hopkins boots. The overacting in Frost Nixon is not the worse thing about the movie. It doesn't depict Nixon or the interview well at all. It's about like watching Oliver Stone's version of what happened. . j'espere qu'il est aussi bien que JFK........je l'ai en dvd mais pas encore vu......un casting de fou (hopkins  woods  boothe  hoskins  harris  walsh...) . irs obama-gate . I'm a big fan of this film but I think it would have worked better without the flashbacks to Nixon's childhood or even the flashbacks from the Eisenhower era and the 1960 and 1962 elections. Most of the information you get from these segments is unnecessary and/or explored in dialogue that takes place elsewhere in the movie. Plus  it's impossible to make Hopkins look like the younger Nixon. I would have kept the focus mainly on Nixon's presidency and the events of Watergate.  . The movie's a bit of a mess  but the cast is AMAZING!! . Could anybody explain to me why the movie involved little to no interaction with either of Nixons Vice-Presidents: Spiro Agnew or Gerald Ford. The movie makes it seem like they never interacted  Im sure neither had anything to do with Watergate but with Cabinet meetings  and advisor meetings something should have been thrown. Unless Stone couldn't find a good actor to play them.  . what a great trailer .  . larry hagmans character never existed in real life  . Nixon- Real life macbeth . This is easily the best politico movie I've ever seen.  It is high drama and an incredible tragedy.   . hopkins was astonishing in this movie...brilliant biopic by oliver stone one of his greatest along with jfk... . That actor who played nixon was a clone to an nbc reporter during the 61' debate. . WTF are you insane. The Doors was superb.  The Doors was a million zillion times better than this. . Yes  and the people of Cambodia miss him too.   :L   A**hole!!! . Hahahaha...Are you being sarcastic dude?  The trailer but me to sleep  nevermind 3hours and 10 minutes of the actual movie. . Awesome trailer.  Makes you want to rush out and see the movie right away. . Those were different times.  Cold war  Pre internet and internet trolling  Demonstrations meant something  Wall Street wasn't the megalithic beast it is today.  Every decade has immensity to it  and we decide where we fit into those decades.  A great adventure is underway. . I'm not really an admirer of Stone. I mean The Doors was embarrasingly poor. However Nixon is a solid effort . I agree that its a masterpiece and is Oliver stones best  and I mostly agree with you ( exept the fact that its the greatest movie of all time  I say Schindlers list is) I love how the film made Nixon look like a bad person but still made him very sympethetic  Hopkin achieves as Richard Nixon. found it to be kinda simular ""Shakespeares Juleas Ceaser"" and ""Citizen Cane . no se parece anthony a nixon xD . Excellent movie!!!!! . I love this movie. I grew up poor and became very successful (like Nixon). I understand Nixon. He loved America. Unlike Obama  Nixon really cared about America!! . I hate the film trailers  because somo of the pictures was removed later on the final movie . Anthony Hopkins  Joan Allen and Paul Sorvino have NEVER been BETTER in a movie -- period!!  :) . Wow  long trailer. Anyway  Hannibal as Nixon? Who knew..... . Stone's movies are always 50/50. 50% accurate (brilliantly) and 50% fictional (brilliantly). This movie is OK  but Hopkins' accent is to present.  . Hopkins sure makes a fat  rotund Nixon. . Of all actors who played Nixon  Hopkins captured the essence of Nixon the best.  .   . (and he's not even American...now THAT is an actor) . Classic?   Are you kidding? . RIC YOUNG is best of MAO!! . @folladordeprostis Right  absolutely.  If Chile gets mentioned  it's only in passing; I should rent this and watch it again. . @michaeld5  the coup of 73 that nixosn supported . @folladordeprostis I don't think it talks about Chile; but I last saw it over ten years ago. . @Lufttygger306  LOL  it was a 'flattop.' . @pat442389 and clinton i forgot about his scandal  . @TheChapaqua its funny how Nixon and LBJ were hated but had greatness in their finger tips. ive said before i think they wanted to be loved like JFK or even RFK but they never will be. just as Pat Nixon says in the movie to nixon. but Nixon and LBJ both brought themselves down in the end  but i also think both bit the bulletfor the greater good of the country. unlike reagan and bush who cheapened the office . Also one of the best movie soundtracks made by John Williams . H. R. Haldeman had funny hair . This movie talks about chile 1973? . ""Dubya"" was not a good man and did not ""earn"" the office of The President - he rigged the 2000 election and then curtailed the investigation into what happened and the American people laid down and died and accepted such a travesty of democracy.  .  . really nice movie by sir anthony.....he can act in any role "

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) fights his old friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) and his wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) for control of his Las Vegas empire.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The inner-workings of a corrupt Las Vegas casino are exposed in Martin Scorsese's story of crime and punishment. The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.

After watching this movie I thought Joe pesci should have won Oscar for this movie . When I started watching movies of these 3 legends with this legendary director Martin Scorsese the Irishman was first I got in my watchlist but I will watch it in end after all the movies of de Niro and Martin Scorsese had done already watched al pacino .

I Wonder if Martin Scorsese have a grudge again Joe Pesci  because he is always dying in his movies  he can't seen to be able to make it out alive. . ❤️ . To be honest this movie puts The Irishman to shame. No offence to Scorsese fans. . Happy belated birthday  Sharon. Have a good one. . Let’s be honest  we will never see this type of movies from another actors ever! Or producers! This 3 right here are the perfect trio for Mafia movies. Pesci  De niro and Scorsese.

Didn't know it was based on a book. . Self destruction is one of Scorsese's key themes and what happens when your ambition outsizes you.  . Not only is it set in Sin City but it's about a civic portrait scribbled in neon in the shape of a rigged wheel. . Scorsese doesn't pause to underline the hypocrisy of men willing to enforce the rules of the casino establishment by any means. It all shown as business as usual.  . The movie does a great job exploring male rituals of one-upmanship and overcompensation.  .

I know this movie is great when I see that it came out the same year I was born . I love this film..wow the best best ever  fantastic acting ! . Godfather  this  scarface  godfellas...the best . I remember watching this as a kid . Playing at the beginning of the movie Bach's St-Matthew Passion  a touching musical piece  is not appropriate for this kind of scenario  showing sordid mafia activities.  But the story was interesting. . Does the film mean Anthony Spilotro? Nicky Santoro died In 2008..... Was this an error in the film! . Gosh Sharon Stone was such a stunning woman. So beautiful! .

Pongan el minuto 1:45 hasta el 1:47 . One of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's . Sadly it was overshadowed by Se7en . One of the best suspense thriller . +erik karlsson the murderer is not a surprise. You see him the whole film. . I love how the trailer shows the murderer... smart. . This is one of those movies that will remain with you it was done so well. . Unfortunately when it came out it was competing with some Box Office Sequels so it was overwhelmed and did well internationally and on rental at that time. . A FANTASTIC MOVIE AND A MUST SEE FOR THE SUSPENSE/THRILLER AND HORROR MOVIE FANS!!! . My JJV rating: 8/10********stars . Whoa fucking chill! I don't even like DMTH Jees! . Øv ville se hele filmen . I love this movie . One of my favorites. . Loved this movie.... This is one movie that really got me scared and i am a horror movie fan.  . Never  never  never  never  never  never  never  NEVER compare Drag me to Hell to Aliens or Copycat EVER again  please.  . There wasn't supposed to be a sequel.

I want a new version of this  I now copies of other movies never gonna be better  but this is so old. I really just want the same actors and all  but just.. new. . I loved it - especially the apartment! : ) . I agree with the killer from Se7en. All the preperation is scarier than anything.  .  . But Buffalo Bill from SotL is just as much of a copycat as ""Peter"". since he copied Ed Gein.  . Or he's carracter is based on Gein anyway.  . Not just as disgusting tho.  .  . ""Peter"" at least chooses to copy the most infamous killers. ^_^ . The concept is definitely one that seems to work and has been used in other movies as well.  This picture certainly wouldn't win any awards  but for some odd reason I enjoy watching it. Really enjoy this genre.  I can still see my mother so totally engrossed in it LOL.  .   . Hmm...a remake might be a good idea.  I for one would love to see it. . TROLL MUCH. . To each his own  I guess.  .   . My mother was spellbound while watching this on TV.   I looked over and she was sitting on the edge of her seat during the entire second half.  Made me laugh because usually movies like this don't grab her in that way.  One of the reasons might have been that Weaver's character looked a lot like her when she was younger  so she associated with her.  .   . Plus I'm a fan of Holly Hunter.. . But your objective obseration and professional judgement don't count  and you don't matter. And how do you know I live in Arizona. For all you know I could be living in Arizona.  .

Excellent  !!!!!!!!! . this is one of the best psychological thriller i have ever watch~ way ahead its time  much more intelligent than most bullshit we have today. The camera work  the haunting score by christopher young and the screenplay is just terrific. But the sad thing is this movie did not the attention it deserves during its release in 1995. . LOVE THIS MOVIE my favorite part is when shes like ""Here kitty kitty kitty"" . Strange. The trailer for THIS movie uses music from The Pelican Brief and Interview with the Vampire...Totally not in the same genre.  . @ReallyFunnyVidsNY Ok... I hope you are having a joke. If not  ana mareed! . one of my favorite thriller movie..... oh Hands rocking the cradle is also good. Why cant we see those kind of thriller movies anymore!!! . @blisterpacman i love annoying u people[: lol anyway idk y i wrote that... . I'm looking for a movie I found in a video store once. I don't remember the title  but it seemed to be about a kind of eco-terrorist like the Unabomber and was apparently made in the 90s. Does anyone know what movie that could be? . @mariopoolpoop1 and what's your point? seriously? . The music of this movie is simply excellent  I hear it everyday from my playlist. . It may be scarier but the killer in this movie doesn't even compare to Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. . So under-rated!  Holly and Sigourney are on fire! . the opening scene of this movie scared the shit out of me when i was little  i never saw the rest of it. . Damn I remmber this vid..... :s  . Scary shit. . Ms. Weaver is great in this movie. VERY thrilling. It got me into 'Murder By Numbers' by The Police. . The music used in this trailer is from 'The Pelican Brief'  another excellent thriller. . Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) FTW!!! . Add more tags! It's hard to find this trailer! By the way  very nice quality. . @mariopoolpoop1 lol'd. . @WednezdayAddamz  what? no . i remember this - god it looks old. . @mariopoolpoop1 hey  is this jessi slaughter .

This is kind of like silence of the lambs.  From watching the movie you would think that the guy in the trailer is the villian of the movie.  Same for Hannibal Lecter in silence of the lambs. . one of the best plots ever . I was joking. Relax. Take a deep breath. I've seen the movie a thousand times. Saludos. . am telling the movie because i feel like it? do you have a problem with that? cause i hope you don´t. i don´t post comments in youtube to start a fight. . Harry Connick Jr is great as a serial killer. . Why are you telling the movie? . one of my all time favorite and a classic!!! love it!! . I watched this when I was about 10 years old and since then I've felt uneasy whenever I went to one of those toilet booth-thingies that are open from the top."

Lol I just sent this to my brother. The first time I watched this movie as a kid a lightning storm rolled through and struck a transformer right outside our window causing a huge explosion and loss of power. We had to watch it the next day when it was restored.  Was fitting with the theme though I'd love to see this murdery version now. . the music at end of trailer i feel is wrong as it makes Powder/Jeremy out to be a demon something relay bad and scary when he wasent okay some of the stuff was scary but he was a really sweet guy . lol bravo you done the impossible...your re-cut trailer with its creepy music made it sound like powder is a psycho serial killer lmao . .ℒℴѵe..ℒℴѵe..ℒℴѵe. . i have this movie on DVD  somewhere also found the full movie on Putlocker one of my fav movie sites . Hey . awesome beautiful movie loved it and i just loved Jeremy yet he could be scary at times with some of the stuff he did  . super emotionaler und mitfühlender film !  . I'm not a fan of this re-cut trailer simply because the cut and music has made this film seem like it's a horror movie. It is deeper than this trailer is portraying it and is giving the wrong impression of its subject. . would like to see a cameo by the superhero freakozoid . work.work. . i totally misssed this gem.... thanks guys.... i left a love note... ksiksi .

Masterpiece  26y ago..... . I saw this movie  why leave las vegas  this movie should be called staying las vegas . This is a great trailer . Cages best film! . Do jaJa . Never knew Nic Cage won an Oscar . thanks brooklyn 99 . now i might watch this.. . what movie...five stars . Leaving Las Vegas movie stripper shorthair blonde name??? . 2018 and this movie is still one of the great ones! . Best soundtrack hands down! . Leaving Las Vegas crushes my heart every time I see it. An awful and beautiful story about how two desperate people fall into a codependent relationship. There are few movies that are as good as this one. . This film is poetry. Elisabeth Shue is breathtaking. . This movie actually did really good at the box office and it's kinda funny to think that this trailer might've been a reason why so many people were attracted to see it. . Everytime I hear someone  talk about leaving las vegas  it always reminds of family guy where that liquor store guy and chris talk about movies. . Oh shit!! My future!! . I love this movie one of the greatest movie of all times.... . Nicolas and Elizabeth have done a Great job . Terrible trailer; great film. . but does he really deserve an Oscar because of this movie !!! . best movie EVER ! . I plan on becoming an alchoholic and killing everyone . Recently saw this movie and it was one of the best ive seen in a long time. Very well put together and touching storyline. One of Cages best works. Great Movie. . That was funny :) . Watching movies just because Nicolas Cage is in it. . Sad beginning  sad characters  sad ending..just a sad movie..: ( . One of my all-time-favourites. . I had a severe drinking problem myself  had to detox twice. . So i know what i'm talking about when i say that this flick is realistic. <3 . Thanks for posting. . I think this movie is the best movie about both alcoholism and Las Vegas. . Your welcome!!!! :P . thx for the spoiler... . I know it seems strange to respond to my own comment but no one else did  so I had to eventually help myself..... . I really didn't know who those two people were until I was relatively sober  then I had the common sense to look them up under the heading ""Leaving Las Vegas full cast"" . The bartender is actor Graham Beckel. . The ""pretty lady"" is actress Mariska Hargitay. . Thank you both for your parts in this great movie. . i came here to drink myself to death  . cry more. . fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk! . this movie sucked... . Precious scene at 0:13. ""I really wish you would come home with me  you're so cute and I'm really good in bed too believe me...... no ?  O.K."" . I will be very impressed if you can tell me the actress that Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) is talking to  it's that pretty lady who licks her lips before her other facial expression rejects him. . The bartender  what's that actor's name ? . You need to appreciate those people  you take them for granted  you probably take way too many people for granted.  . Dude!!! I'm a male and my comment has nothing to do with feminism. It's about how rapists piss me off. . It's because of how realistic that scene was. Didn't you get mad when you watched that scene? . Loved the film so much I felt the same way. power of cinema. .  . why would anything like the lack of a moral ever persuade you that something was worth hating?  . easy  man :) It's just a film. . I love this movie. I can relate so well to cage in this. . I love this movie  but the reason I watch it over and over is because Elizabeth Shue is so hot. It is almost distracting.  . como nicolas cage de living las vegas  . rubius!!!!!!! . NICHOLAS CAGE TE ESTA OBSERVANDO O_O . nicolas nunca muda mesmo kkk . If this is good  what is awesome? . This trailer prepares you for absolutely 0% of what you watch...  . You should watch Requiem for a dream. If you can make it through the whole film without feeling sick  then you're seriously disturbed. . You obviously didnt get the point then lol . Makes it look like a film about 2 people who turn their lives around when its anything but that. Also makes it seem alot more lighthearted than it actually is. . Lol  Nic Cage worste actor. . This film is the truth and notting but the truth. .  . i miss voice overs in movie trailers . Couldn't agree anymore!! . he look like hunter s.thompson . A masterpiece. I needed a big shot of whiskey myself after watching this film.  . Your comment made me weep. This movie is earth shattering for people that battle drinking and REALIZE IT. Thank you for saying it....... really hit home. . You get a LOL for that comment from me!! Good on ya!!!!! . What do you mean? . the only thing i hate about this movie is the frat boys that raped sera get away with it. i wanted to see them get beat up  jailed  castrated  or even killed. i just wanted to reach through the screen and fuck those guys up. what a bunch of creeps  she didn't want to have anal with them. so  they just go and beat the shit out of her  and fuck her up real bad. i wish all rapist would have their balls cut off. . All these '90s trailers were always so upbeat for such depressing films!!!! . Thank you . its lonely teardrops by michael mcdonald . did you find it? . very good movie .  . what's the soundtrack called by the way ???  .  . What type of movie is it? . Anyone who has ever been to the point of their lives where they believe that they will eventually die living that VERY point that brought them there should watch this movie  you are not alone. . and where the trailers spoil the whole movie . Are you sure that is the same movie? . Not a good trailer for this movie. . what a shitty commercial.  . I've seen better. The movie was kinda boring honestly . @WorleyClarence no  u did it cuz ur a dumb fuck. . @TheEirinaki95 Come Rain  or Come Shine. . oh hollywood  did you try to make a movie about turning a hoe into a housewife  even worse you used crazy nicolas to be the leading man. I can understand richard geare but nicolas cage? Well then thats called crack head falls in love with street hooker . In the end credits: The events  characters  and firms depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons  living or dead  or actual firms is purely concidental. . The worst part about this trailer  is the narrator.  . @roscoegino Haha good point :') it's a terrible loss for the acting industry  what he really needs is a film like Kick Ass again: a blockbuster that actually shows his considerable talents :) . @Jeffo193 They don't pay for mansions he can't afford. . Why is his major addiction to alcohol so subtle and hidden in this trailer? It plays a massive part in the film... . I love how the trailers change through time. If this was a trailer now  it would be considered appalling.  . This movie showed Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue at their very best. It's about a codependent relationship between an alcoholic (Cage) hell bent on drinking himself to death and a prostitute (Shue) that attempts to give him unconditional love. This movie will break your heart and show you want really good acting is all about. . Worst trailer for a really great movie . Shue hasn't aged well.....she used to be top class. . nick cage won the oscar for this role! . @Fanofcartoons1994  .  . Agreed. This movie was very serious and sad. . Most people who live in this city has a love/hate relationship with her.  . @ingasa13 coz it wont come in 3D and theres no happy meal toys that'll come with it. . @naklip It's ""Lonely Teardrops"" the famous version was by Jackie Wilson  but this one is sung by Michael McDonald (that used to be a Doobie Bro. and sometimes sang for Steely Dan) . @PetroniusSatyricon69 Ha  I know! I loved this movie and knew then that I never wanted to see it again. Damn good actor.  . Top Movie . @tareyagreen Haha  I know right? This trailer makes the movie seem like it has some lovey-dovey happy ending  . @naklip lol .  . yeah this story is horrible  desperate and sad  totally inappropriate music and narrator! . @Jeffo193  Totally agree. This movie shows the great potential of what Cage can do with good material  or wise versa.  Sad to see such a great actor waste his talent on movies like Drive Angry or The sorc Apprentice. . But i guess that's what happens when you bankrupt yourself  you're forced to take whatever gets tossed in your way..  Beggars can't be choosers. .  . A real loss for the acting industry.  .  . @EGarrett01 And also  because some of the trailers i posted had more quality that the ones who were already on youtube. . @EGarrett01 I put ""hq"" to get more views  kind of stupid when i think about it now. I have to remove it in all the trailers. . @EGarrett01 LoLOlOLoLol"

The way Christina Ricci owned the 90s 🖤 . Ten Bucks . Rosie O'Donnell I Don't Wanna Be Told To Grow Up Simple Plan . This movie is when I really started liking Christina  but 2 things bug me still... .  . 1. they spend so much time making the point of friends helping each other through tough times and then end the ""Then"" part by saying oops the treehouse brought them ""independence from each other"" and the ""Now"" versions of them don't even care about meeting up hardly ever. .  . 2. In all these years STILL they haven't done a release with the carnival scenes and any other deleted scenes. And not even a blu ray release either. I'd like to have a release with tons of new scenes because I like the whole setting of the movie and it's pretty short and no sequel  so such a small amount of time to see them in that setting. Also  personally  I'd hope for them put all back into it as a director's cut where the movie is longer. . I totally forgot that this was called The Gaslight Addition in the beginning  even while Christina was talking about it. .  . Also  funny they dubbed in a different word in the trailer for when Roberta says what she will do if Devon's character tells his friends that they kissed. . I had a childhood like this. I feel like as a  millennial we grew up with technology and the outside. I was born in the end of the 80s and so  I remember being thrown outside and fighting my cousin and friends. Riding my bike and skateboard and running amok about my backyard. Than finished the day off with some video games on Sega. . It’s sad because teeny saves Sam . I loved this movie 🎥 as a child and even now and I’m a millennial !!! I really enjoyed it ! . I feel like us 90s kids were the last generation to grow up outside lol our parents used to lock us out of house during the summers hahahaha! . So Roberta and Scott already shared a kiss in Casper ❤️ . Llevo tiempo buscandola . Donde la puedo ver por favor ? . Any fellow ‘95 babies here? . love how this movie and Casper both came out the year I was born - 1995 . Christina Ricci  grows up to be Rosie O'Donnell  boy did they get that wrong . A few scenes were changed afterward! Love this movie! . Didn't care for the casting of adult version of the characters. Except for Demi Moore . DEMI MOORE YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL . This movie is iconic with a killer soundtrack. I remember a friend showing me this when I was a kid back in 1999 and it stuck with me for over a decade until I found it again after many attempts of searching for it because I didn’t know the name of it lol . so jealous my childhood wasn’t like this . Born in 1989  watched this movie with my twin sister in my early childhood.... and remembered it today... overflown by memories 🥺❤ . I feel that way too IF My Parents were like that living in a Different state living in a place like that . Put it on Netflix and Starz on demand . That song at 1:29- The nostalgia!!! . Lol . 1995: this is wholesome and relevant  . 2020: Cuties on netflix iz da devil AAAAAAH!!!!! join with me this cool Kool-Aid is guuud! drink it at the same time prudes! . Me wishing I was born then . Rip Ashley Moore . Best movie! . I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s this movie was basically what my childhood was like. I feel sorry for kids nowadays. . I  used to watch this with my grandma and my fav was chrissy . “Now and then” is my all time movie . Awesome ""coming-of-age"" movie  like ""Stand By Me""  except with girls. . pls tell me where can i watch this. I really need to watch this. Just gimme the link or whateva. It’s not available on netflix anyway. . Rest In Peace Ashleigh Aston Moore AKA Chrisy . Ricci!!!!! ❤️ . I feel like Bonnie Hunt ad-libbed that ""boo ha"" line. . My childhood . 👍👍👍👍 small boy and girl small beautiful excellent movie . MY CHILDHOOD IS RUINED IF I DIDNT WATCHED THIS MOVIE . A warmth around my heart this movie brings... So many childhood memories.. Me and my friends used to have a childhood like this   without technology and just playing on the street all day long on summer.. Riding our bikes  singing  making “movies” and “concerts” and who knows what else.. We were so blessed and happy to be growing up in 90s. I believe it was the last decade we could have been old school children. There was no wifi  smartphones  selfies fake lives made on fb and instagram  we were just out there playing and dreaming... We were out there being KIDS! Oh how I wish those times could come back. I still dream of going to video store to borrow a movie and just living that simplicity we once had.. Silly I know..Who knows  maybe we wake up one day from a matrix and start living true lives once again. Ahh  we grew up so fast didn’t we..?!? ☺️ Anyway.. God bless you all.. And kids  if you’re reading this: GO OUT AND PLAY!! Life is fantastic! ❤️ . N gf 95 😀dkaa dkasad  d dkc r dkc . One of my favorite movies . Dakota Johnson looks so much like her mom here. . Love this movie. Brings back great memories of childhood . TEENY AND ROBERTA ARE MY FAVORITES BECAUSE THEY REPRECENT MY 2 PASSIONS MOVIES AND SPORTS . Guys where is scott in the ending? . I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! . One of my all time favorite movies! . Just finished watching this movie and I wish my childhood was as fun as theirs😔. Great movie  10/10  would recommend 😚 . If you like this movie I recommend gold diggers The secret of Bear mountain it's really good and has Anna chlumsky from my girl and Christina Ricci from this movie and basically it's like an adventure type movie it's very good I will get movie suggestions from my father and ask him if there's any movies similar to that and this was one he suggested but it took a while to watch because it's very hard to find to rent so I had to order the DVD but a great movie either way 😁 . Guys this is probs how your grans looked in there time . Omg! I can't believe that the song ""I want you back"" Was covered and sung by the kpop group Twice! . I wish they picked another actress than Rosie O’Donnel . Komentar 282 . This movie is my whole child hood  like I watched this movie everyday from the age of like 2- 10 but I forgot about it and know I have no idea how to watch it . Hold up isn’t that the boy who played Casper the friendly ghost when Christina’s character’s mom helped him turn into his human form for Halloween night? 🤔🤔 . sometimes i wish smartphones and social media didn't exist  because now kids grow up too fast without actually having fun (i'm 16 btw) . A classic❤ . Fave movie ever:) nostalgic . ‘Gimme the drugs or I’ll kill you’ made me laugh 😂 so much . so in the movie  the gorgeous Christina Ricci grows up to be rosie o donnell. that's pretty harsh . where can i watch it . They don't make movies like this anymore . My fave . Anyone watch this as a kid and think how did Christina Ricci become Rosie O'Donnell?!!!! Shortchanged. . i reeaally want to watch this but i feel like i'll get too sad . I love this movie . Seing this . I miss my childhood so bad . Every time I watch this movie 🎥  it makes me miss my childhood 😢 . watching it then .  &  now again 2020.... .  RIP crissy . I💙this movie! Always did!!! . I hate it. .  . This movie has got to be a parody of Stand By Me. . My childhood movie!! 😁❤️💗❤️💗❤️💗 . R.I.P. Ashleigh Aston Moore 😢😢😢 . I still remember the weekend I rented this movie from Blockbusters! I loved it so much and watched it multiple times until we had to return it. Then got the DVD and soundtrack. It was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Still love it at 32! . Wow this movie 😍😍 anyone feeling the nostalgia . . I wish my childhood was like this . This movie brings back memories . ugh they removed it from netflix . What is song right at beginning . I got drag as a teenager to watch this with a girl🤣🤣 . How do I get this movie!! I have been looking for it everywhere . i love this movie so much i Watch this for a long time . Oh the memories... This movie will always be a beautiful part of my childhood. . Havent seen this since 1995.  Was a excellent movie. Sad that it doesnt get shown as often as Stand By Me or The Sandlot does as it fits perfectly with these 2 classics as well. . Best movie ever . Such a wholesome movie :) . Seen this many times over the years. Great coming-of-age flick. Sad to think that Ashleigh Aston Moore who played the young Chrissie died a number of years back. . I honestly wish my child hood was this instead of having technology and ppl playing Fortnite all the time . Apparently this is on Netflix but I can’t find it??? . Great cast!! . Good gawd  what a crappy movie this was. No wonder it'll never get the Blu-ray treatment much less a digital release at all. Total rip-off of the far superior and original classic  'Stand By Me'. Bivvvvv . This is my favorite movie . Christina Ricci does NOT = Rosie O’Donnell wtfffffffffff 😤 . Spent my childhood watching this lmao . Not a big fan of hers  but Melanie Griffith had knockout legs back in her day . Why didn’t I see 1:45???? . Jew at  was GAY!!"

The only clownish thing about the film that keeps it from being a complete masterpiece is the weird circus parade right near the end. . I very much enjoyed this movie  but I also like the earlier movie as well. I think the depth of feeling shows better in the earlier version than this one. I do not think the trailer quite describes the movie as it was.  There are feelings hard to put in a movie. Anyway  I did love this movie and  also the other version  which I think is from 1971. . Haha! If I hadn’t seen  this movie before I would totally be fooled by the trailer it makes it sound like an exciting passionate love fest🤔 In reality it is a beautifully acted and perfectly made adaptation of my favourite book. Remember seeing it on BBC 2 when first released and even went to see it when it was released in the cinema.  Now treasure it on DVD. Ciaran Hinds was so handsome as Wentworth and Amanda Root was brilliant as Anne.😉 . one film that actually needs a reboot.. . My most favorite movie! . I like this story so much and I hadn't had the courage to watch this version of 1995 for a long time  because Anne seemed to me ugly. But now I have finally watched this movie and I didn't see anything ugly - quite normal Anne)) The actress presented quite a convincing Anne. Liked this version. Especially the scenes where Anne had to listen to the Musgroves who were complaining her about one another in turn) . what's with the ""honest movie trailer's"" voiceover? . These american voice overs :D . God  what an awful trailer! Nothing at all to do with the film  which is lovely and not about a passion that could destroy them both. This is Jane Austen  not a bodice ripper ffs. . This trailer just makes me laugh. The only true thing is that the main character indeed looks scared for half of the film: from mildly corncerned to a ""deer in headlights"". . Superb film  but a travesty of a trailer which gives a completely distorted impression of the film. . What classical piece begins to play at 0:07? It is driving me crazy that I can't find it anywhere! . This trailer is ridiculous ... . Never mind  the film is fabulous and very true to the book. . Some posters wrote that the main female character is ""ugly"". I don't see it.  . Amanda Root is not the conventional pretty heroine  she is rather plain in the beginning (but never ugly!)  but the longer she's near Captain Wentworth  the prettier she gets. She really blossoms like a flower when he speaks to her and you see that he notices.  . In my opinion Amanda Root is perfect in this role and Ciarán Hinds - swoon ... . The whole cast is very well chosen and looks so authentic. . This trailer doesn't do the film justice. I hate the man's voice over! The 1995 version is the best of any adaptation on film. It is perfection. . That man is the hottest 😍😍😍 ( I'm young but I adore him) . It's hard to believe this was originally made for television  then released in movie theaters.  This movie is a MASTERPIECE.  It's artful  brilliantly acted  and has an organic beauty about it that you won't see anywhere else. . Amanda Root just is Anne Elliot! . ESTA  ESTA  EN  ESPAÑOL  POR FAVOR . This is truly one of the worst trailers I've ever seen. . Every single person I have ever dated have no wealth  no titles and no connections.  Lady Russell would never approve. . I wish they would re-make this movie . This trailer is a masterclass in video editing. I think there isn't a single sentence in this that isn't completely ripped out of context and misleading. It's an entirely different film in fact than the one I love. Which is strongly acted  sedately paced and very close to the book in many respects. . Don't be put off by this trailer. The film is NOT about a passion that could destroy them both (what?) If you love the book  you will love this version. . It's one of my favorites... . I've never seen this and I've heard that it's good  but it sure doesn't look much like Jane Austen's book."

Amazing visuals. . I know your comment's 2 years old  but if you're still wondering  the song is ""L'Anniversaire d'Irvin"" from this movie's soundtrack. . I'm pretty sure the clip of the clone putting the lid over the camera is an alternate take from the scene in the actual film  which is kind of neat. . Come to think of it  I don't remember that scene of the scientist seeing the kids through the periscope. I gotta wonder how much was cut from the final version. . Bioshock .  This movie is so old it should be public domain by now.  I owned this on magnetic tape  for heaven's sake.  Sony Pcitures are a bunch of cheapos for not letting you view it in full.

I had already thought Gong Li was among the very best actors on the world  and so beautiful. Her beauty in this film took my breath away.

Ghetto school drama with Michelle Pfeiffer playing the role of school teacher to a class of street misfits...  Supported by a great R&B/Gangster rap soundtrack.",PT1M57S,1132163,4564,139,0,414,"I work with kid's like these  done this for like 25 years now  for free. Just because I love them. And of course  this is my favorite film ever 🥰💕 . The book Quiet by Susan Cain brought me here :)... . If only they played Dungeons and Dragons and read lord of the rings instead. 👍 . This movie does have bones "" You and Me!"".... . None of the actors/actresses who played the students. I didn’t really see any of them I’m anything else . Kazzy  fifa? . this is like the birth of Jesus. . This is by far one of the best movies you can ever watch. . Imagine pureflex remake this 2021 no curse words in it . Once a Marine  always a Marine! . me and kazz! . I get goosebumps every time I watch this. I have lived on and off the streets since I was 14. I went to a special ed school called Norwood morialta cause it was the only school that would take me. It doesn't matter what color skin you got cause I know I'm a white gangsta. And I am proud of being a gangsta . 187 (1997) was better than this trite movie . Meme song go funny haha .

I went to this school. In the movie  it's called Parkmont  but the school is really called Carlmont High School  in Belmont California. The movie is based of a book called ""My Posse don't do Homework"" and was written in 1992  so obviously I wasn't alive back then  but I remember by AP US history teacher telling us about the woman who wrote this book and her story. It seems so surreal to me  even now  that I went to the school where this story took place. . They should remake this movie . Think she genuinely wanted to help them   but like she said you all gotta choose  think she worded it wrong at times although she never meant to make them feel inadequate (she wondered how she could teach them what a verb was  not because they lacked intelligence quite the opposite I think)..know your kids  know how they work  know how they learn  know how they feel and master it to gain respect and make there learning fun  then they will listen if you save one at least you did something and that is an achievement in itself  so never give up teaching  if you don't like what you teach how can you expect your kids too? All teachers have a tough rap but never give up your learning them more than you think . 2020?? . ""There are no victims in this classroom"" yet  the same bunch keep trying to convince people they are victims of the system and thus taking away their willpower to achieve success. . C00chieman . I love this movie. Wish there was more teachers like her now days. There hard to find now. . What are the scenes of 1:14 and 1:18?🥺🥺 . I remember going to theater to see this. .

I thought the way the students acted was really true to life. I remember being in school and I remember kids like this and how they would engage with an inspiring teacher like Michele Pfeiffers character.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a futuristic world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
An intense film about time travel, this sci-fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam, a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.

Both 'sides'  if you will  were represented. I met the real Sister Prejean while I was a Criminology major  the year this movie was released.  The scene at the end (where the boy and his girlfriend were brutally murdered) in the woods  confirmed my unwavering approval of the death penalty. . I don't know if it ever has been  but this script would make a very good stage play . I'm writing to 3 people on deathrow very realistic . people keep doing spoilers. Not good . Susan Sara my love . very bad movie of all time . This movie requires a lot of empathy for both the killer and his victim's families to be truly appreciated. If you see life in black and white this is a good film to challenge how you look at the world. He had no sympathy when he helped kill an innocent teenage couple  now the state will have no sympathy when they execute him. In the middle of it all is a nun that has sympathy for both the killer and the victims. . what surprised me the most is that i did not cry watching this movie and i'm big crier . Typical liberal drivel...but what do you expect given that three idiots that made it. . Awful movie which promotes murder and rape apologia  no matter how you try to spin it. . What's with the Powaqqatsi soundtrack? . I've seen the movie in english and german and I must say the movie in english is better than in german😅 Matthew in the movie is hot😍😱 . It's like the same thing  he favors Edward Norton in American History X  bad parts and the scary thing is they look alot alike . Damn  Sean Penn got that handsome Jesus look  but ugghh  why do the sexy ones always have to be the bad boys  grrr! Fine as hell though😍😎 . tres tres tres bon film à voir . You have to watch the movie multiple times to get all backgrounds and thoughts... Great movie and a must watch! After it you will deny excecutions! . Whats the name off the group that sings when he is going to the excecutionroom Dead Man Walking please if anyone knows tell me thanx . i cried a lot while watching this movie . i need it for projection in class...plz where can i download it in french version. . HERSHEL . Great movie  started to fell in love with Sean  got very much disturbed after seeing this. Fabulous acting by Sean and Susan........... . 00:26 Wait? Isn't? Isn't that Herschel from The Walking Dead? :o . Oh my goodness!! This movie was the best movie!! I really believed that he did not do the crime. But he had a very powerful ending. I was in tears after he confessed.  I was very devastated. Wow!! I would not want her job ever. . Sean Penn is so sexy ... WHOOOH!! . This movie is so great! We watched it at school because we had this issue in a subject about death row etc.. and at the end I cried so damn hard..I felt so queasy that I couldn't even watch the scene in which he dies... I just sat there staring in the opposite direction and cried  cried and cried....great movie! Unforgettable! Shivering.. . Dead man walking -greaves LOL- . great movie !! . RIP Hal Douglas . Anybody else notice its the same music played on the ""Philadelphia"" trailer? . I know this is irrevelant but the background music is from ""the Truman Show - Anthem Part 2"" . When you right click a zombie in runescape and click Examine you see a text that says ""Dead Man Walking"" wich is a reference to this movie :D . :06 = Rhett Mclaughlin . He idd commit the crme Mordeco T and he dies at the end . Some people read the comments to see if the film is worth watching  not for some cocky asshole to spoil the whole movie for everyone . thank you  I will look for another movie now.  . you find out he did shoot the guy at the end of it . Damn. This movie is on tv right now but I don't want to watch it if he ends up dying for a fuckin' crime he didn't commit. . day 126 still looking for the original comment . that's the truth though. . puta que pariu esta publicidade idiota .  . I watched this today in school in RE I cried so much! :( they shouldn't show what he actually did :'( . So the plot of the movie is to see whether he gets executed or not . Ojo por ojo y el mundo acabará tuerto. . tres beau film intense......les années 90 quoi.... . Robert Prosky is in quite a few movies about execution  he's in this movie  as well as The Green Mile and The Chamber. . I agree!  . What about the man who raped and killed a 6 month old baby? He was executed- and he deserved it :(  . Nice movie! Learn some things about death penalty!  . The things robert lee willie and his pal joe vaccaro did are much worse than what was depicted in this work of fiction  though what was depicted was quite horrible. The girls he raped and killed had no choice in the matter  but he did. He didn't have to do what he did  but he has to pay the price. What it will solve is keeping him out of this world to murder more people. .  . WTF  does anyone realise this background music is strikingly similar to the song off The Truman Show? I think it's called paranoia/realisation? . Getting a bullet to the head is cheaper . Murder is the killing of the innocent. . The killing of the guilty is not murder. .  . Don't equivocate. . death penalty is just murder commited by the government  just because its legal still doesn't solve anything. Isnt the whole point of the legal system not just justice but also corrections for whoever commited a crime  there's nothing to correct when their dead . The death penalty solves nothing - it just creates more violence. While I understand the eil this man did  state sanctioned murder is no way to solve anything. Those 2 kids are still dead  the girl was still raped  and the families must surely still be grieving. This man's execution did not  nor will it ever  take any of that away. It just compounded the issue. Life w/no parole would have been suffecient enough; & he would have had years to consider what he'd done.  .  . You do understand  don't you  that the character in the movie is really a composite ofseveral of the death row inmates she visited with  right? I'm in the middle of reading this book now  and it's obvious that is the case. Yeah  I saw the movie 1st and am just now reading the book  but I can tell you that's the case. Have YOU read the book? And yeah  they changed the names of nearly everyone in the movie except Sister Helen.  . Yeahhhh.....buuuut  why should the society's resources be devoted to maintaining a criminal who committed murder. I mean  we are talking of several million dollars.   . There was a quote from this movie that Sister Helen said and that was:  . 'Why kill someone to prove that killing someone else is wrong?'  . I don't support what he did in any way possible  but I was crying when I watched this.  . i agree  but i don't think it should be the concern of well behaved citizens to teach and forgive  or punish in that case  i think vengeance is fair  i think is healthy for a society to do what is right  and kill those that are stupid. we are too many  there is not enough resources or space to be fucking around  this are the times to cooperate this is the time for science and evolution  any one else that is still a primitive asshole should be discarded  . best actor Sean Penn . Sr. Helen Prejean just came and spoke to my school about the death penalty. She is one incredible woman. . That's my other argument against the death penalty. There's no death penalty in the UK because they made too many mistakes. . OK does ANYONE know the name of the music used in this trailer or who composed it? . jusqu'ou va  le pardon et existe t'il ? A votre jugement... . omg Sean Penn looks so sexy in this movie!!! . i know this sounds horrible but anyone who is a murderer dosent deserve to have there life and rape is even worse its disgusting anyone who would do that is horrible why should they have there life when they have took someone else s and put them through so much pain . @forevaevanescense The true definition of murder is the unjustified taking of someone's life. For a rapist or murderer to be executed is not murder. It is the justified taking of anothers life  call it homicide if you like. Also  the only reason the death penalty cost more is because bleading hearts like you cause so much a of a fuss. Let that murderer who gets out on parole get hold of your daughter then lets talk. . @ab411 homicide is the taking of anothers life  either accidentally or with justification. Murder is the unjustified taking if anothers life. So the answer to your question is no. . there death certificate will say homicide which means the killing of one human by another. And since the killing was done knowingly.. doesn't that mean murder ??  . The death penlty is wrong. No forget wrong it is Legal Murder. Definition of murder: Unlawfully killing someone intentialy. Definition of Legal: Established or permited by law. So Legal Murder is Killing someone intentialy permited by law. Sounds like murder to me. Any way murders should live so they can see there victims dyeing eyes whenever they try to sleep. But they also deserve a second chance seeing as they are still human. . Murder is taking a life when you plan to do it. So under that ofical defenition the Death Penlty is murder.   . (Please don't hate me for having an opinion. If you don't like it ignore it). . I'm upset that they changed the story. I preferred the book far more than the movie  however the movie was very good. . You do realize that it is MORE expensive and uses up MORE of your tax dollars to execute someone than to keep them alive and in prison? . I just can't see why I as a taxpayer should pay to keep these sub-humans alive  with all their rights respected. They have no remorse whatsoever for what they did- never have and never will.They've spent their entire lives being arseholes. . Death is the easy way out. The legal methods of execution are only momentarily painful. After that they get an eternity of peace. Make them rot in jail for the rest of their miserable lives- that's the worst thing we could do to them legally. It's your best shot at making them pay and regret what they did.  . Everybody needs to just chill out about the death penalty  because that's not even what this movie's about. It's about redemption and dying with our souls intact. If they'd taken the death penalty out of the story and made it about a man with a life sentence dying of cancer or something in jail  it would have been the same story with the same message.  . Agreed.In my part of the world  FIVE vile  useless pieces of filth abducted a young girl  robbed her  raped her repeatedly all three ways  bashed and tortured her  dragged her by the hair through barbed wire fencing  made her beg for her life  then sawed off her head. As if that wasn't enough  they  then raped the death injury itself. If anyone can give me ONE good reason why they should receive 3 meals a day etc for the rest of their lives  I'd like to hear it. They deserved death. . i thought it was a zombie movie . dead man waliking. isn't it obvious?? . eventually death penalty is more expensive than a life long inprisonment. just a fact. . And what does @ 1.40 gunnrey sergeant Hartman from ""Full metal Jacket"" there... . 1. Murdering is bad. Execution isn't a 'nice' or 'good' thing to do. But it has to be done. .  . 2. Long prison sentence? So the tax payers money that COULD be used to better everyone; the needy  the poor e.c.t. should instead be spent on keeping rapists or murders alive and comfy for many years? .  . Sorry but death sentence is necessary. . Why does Penn look like Layne Stayley . The comments made me wanted to watch this movie . 1:40 was that R. Lee Ermey? . Sean Penn delivers as usual. . so good film! . Well made intelligent film. . Certainly the most powerfull film ever made about death penalty. Finally a film that shows that the meanest scumbag deserves more than a legal murder. On the other hand  the reason why Poncelet finally becomes a man is because death is upon him. Also the religious mumbo jumbo escapes me. Anyway  although I am still firmly opposed to death penalty  I still struggle with the idea that as a man  maybe death is the only way to decently pay your debt  but I still believe other ways are possible. . watched that today... i cried at the end. . U can totally disagree that death penalty is not good but if it happened to your kid/ your gf or wife then dude  there is no way you will not want that man who committed that crime to die  it would totally make sense then!! Think about it in another way  think about it as if u were the victim then decide if death penalty is enough  I say it's not  he should be tortured to death! . brilliant .  . That's a good question that no body else has asked. CAn we hand down the death penalty to someone who killed another  purely in self-defence????.......mMybe he/she was about to be raped  a burglar entered their home and was about to kill them and their family/children. Can we draw the line at self-defence and say it's okay to murder then? In MY OPINION....YES!! Others may disagree  but that is MY OPINION. . @racewalkking13 No government can justify murder as correctly defined. The death penalty is not murder  unless the convicted is innocent. That's why the death penalty and the way it is handed down needs to be revisited. I suppose taking a man's life in self defense is murder? . Murder is murder. Man killing man is murder  any way you look at it. Don't try to cover up what the death penalty really is by saying murder is only defined as unjustly taking a life. And if so  murder being defined in that way  is there any way a government can justify such a thing?  . the emotions.  not knowing how to articulate those emotions.  pray to God and just ask... it really will happen.  and wait for a real answer . it is written.  in the last days   it will be man.  against man.  WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF   in his shoes...  we've all sinned in some way or another.  We're not talking about getting away with crimes.  That's silly.  but we are talking about saving people and then with a real healing from God   we all will become the person we were meant to be.  and we will be free.  so what does that really mean. .  . there really is a God.  there really is an evil source.  devil.  it comes in different forms.   . @chazzalinko Putting someone to death for murder is not murder. Murder is taking someone's life unjustly  usually in a violent manner with malice and forethought. Putting someone to death is justice. You're not taking their life unjustly. You are justified in taking it. Therefore it is not murder. . I dont support what Poncelet did at all  but i dont think he deserved to be killed. It defeats the purpose of punishment  if you murder someone to show that murdering is bad. He should have got a loooong looooong prison sentence  not death.  . And by the way your arrogant little quips like ""would you like a lollypop"" are stupid  unnecessary and quite annoying. "

Movies like this are usually always good but also unrealistic.

This movie is 3 years before that one. . This is like parent trap . Future   stepmother  was  too  bussy    thats   what  made  movie   wonderful .

They are a Scottish Mob family in Melbourne  the Horsemen are Biker Gang Members  the Witches are Gothic School Girls and the sword fights are Shootouts in the city and tunnels and bushland . Okay this is confusing and completely inaccurate Richard the third lived in 1400 . Magneto . Iron Man  . Professor McGonagall  . Professor Horace Slughorn  . Mar-Vel Captain Marvel former boss and enemy . For anyone looking for the music that starts at 1:52  it's Belshazzar's Feast 'Then Sing Aloud to God'. (The version in the trailer is edited a bit  though.) . Robert hahahah perfect . A cheesy commercial for a brilliant film.... . The trailer makes it look like they wanted this to be shown as a double feature together with Die Hard 3. . Near the end  when King Richard's jeep gets stuck in the mud and soldiers on horseback ride on past   he cries out ""A horse   a horse  my kingdom for a horse..."" . I distinctly remember coming home one night in 1997  turning on the TV and stumbling upon this film. It was the scene in the morgue where Ian McKellen talks to Kristin Scott Thomas. I was utterly amazed with this masterpiece of cinematography and it is still one of my favorite ones. . 1984? . IS LIKE TITUS And romeo  and juliet. . Of course they have to make it about Nazis. Might as well call it Edward VIII.. lol . B . maggie smith- hasn't aged a day. . What song is that at 1:52 . 0:50 Stop! Is Iron Man yelling at Magnito? . Between this and the Hopkins version of “Titus”. It’s hard to say what my favorite Shakespeare adaptation is. Both are great. . I like his wild boar. . How many killings? . This movie is a horrible presentation of a William Shakespeare play. . Shakespeare died in 1616 . and wrote a story of a king in 1483.  . YET the costumes are 1940 fashion and the characters are driving in cars not invented until the 1900's .  Meanwhile  the vocals are not only spoken in Shakespeare's horrid  stage-play style of poetry writing (I'll never understand why people like that) BUT the vocals are not recorded well so inaudible most of the time ranging from mumbles to screetches.  Meanwhile  the background music is so loud its deafening. . If the director was aiming for a modern theme on a story of ancient history  such as has been done with the fictional story of Romeo & Juliet (Leonardo DiCaprio)  it doesn't work here because this is actual history and shouldnt be 'time altered'. . Great cast of actors in a horrible movie. . This looks fucking retarded.  Great job  Hollywood jews! . richard 3 reich . At the beginning  the narrator sounded it like a bond film . Never mock your Royal Children only correct them! . Man Richard the lionheart was a man guy. . Excellent! . i love the ending  where he shoots his own man through the brain  then leaps into an inferno laughing his head off while a jazzy upbeat Al Jolson track kicks off!  .  . a fantastic wicked villain . MAGNIFICA . A movie ahead of its time with many important stories from what happened during the 17th  18th  19th and 20th century with some liberty here and there  some dark humor  excellent choice of actors . They don't make movies like this anymore . ( wow Maggie Smith looked old back then still in Downtown Abbey show she looks the same strange ?? ) . What the fuck is this? . Richard the turd. . Everyone complains about spoilers in modern day trailers yet this one spoils a ton of the film lol. . this looks epic. cannot believe that I did not see this. . so metal... . Actually  for a movie that good  the trailer is rather unpalatable and perhaps misleading... . Frank Underwood is based off of Richard . What the hell is this? I expected a 15th Century historical representation of Richard III. This looks like a mid-Twentieth Century iteration of the Shakespearean play  which by the way is not historically accurate  because of political considerations concerning the Tudor dynasty. . never thought i'd see richard III as hitler.. . As it has never been told before? It's a pretty old play. it's been told exactly this way for centuries. . And Englands flag at the time was The three lions of England on a red backround and the fluer de lis of France against a blue backround on a qaurtred flag . This is Richard III of England right who ruled in late medieval times and was not a Nazi and existed 450 years before Hitlers rise . God bless us and to our family!!! . Your brain fu-ked. Your brain off. What is the culture? Nothing. . I really don't know what to make of the film.  Some of it is absolutely sublime -- the transposition to a totalitarian state is brilliant and conveys to the modern audience exactly how chilling Shakespeare meant the rise of Richard III to be  lying  cheating and murdering his way to the top  all the while managing to convince everyone -- from the women he seduces to the confederates he first wins to his cause and then betrays and has slaughtered when he has no further need of them -- that he is their ally.   Unlike so many ""modern"" versions of Shakespeare  it is completely on point. .  . On the other hand  they have certainly taken some liberties with the story.  Richmond waking before the battle and saying he has enjoyed the sweetest sleep ever conveys the impression that this is because he has enjoyed some great sex beforehand (and is about to enjoy some more)  rather than having had the ghosts of all of Richard's victims wishing him success in his dreams  which is a pretty key point of Shakespeare's version.  And Queen Margaret's oh-so-prophetic curse at the beginning of the play has been lost. .  . Still  the gamble certainly pays off -- and once again (as he did with ""Macbeth"")  Sir Ian is absolutely perfect in the role. . I have only seen parts of this film but Ian McKellen gave a phenomenal performance as the controversial York king. One of these days I am going to watch this from start to finish. The cast is just GREAT!!! . ach ihr briten   das böse am briten ist halt deutsch   gell . drum heissen sie auch haus windsor und nicht mehr haus hanover . . A fantastic adaption! . The true monster is the length of the drama  making it as hard as possible to finish shortly before a test. That's actually the real meaning of it. Also  Shakespeare is ennervating with his damn over-the-top passion. That's fine in your leisure  but not necessarily in a serious context... . Magneto vs Iron Man . I didn't know that Professor McGonnagall had a son called Gandalf. . Great playwright. I still think Macbeth is a better villian lol XD . A blu-ray release would be nice... . God  it's like the narrator can't decide if he's doing an American or British accent. . I fucking love this film but this trailer is just so... urgh . This movie made Richard III into one of my heroes.  It also has one of the greatest seduction scenes in all of film. . Absolutely one of my all-time favourites. Saw it many times  still have to get the DVD. Superbly filmed  a brilliant cast  and the way they incorporated some of the landmark buildings in the story is really great. Ian McKellen is pure evil in this and boy  does he do a good job at being evil. . I love Laurence Olivier's version but wow this looks cool! . what is the name of the song near the end"

The first ever Robert Downey Jr movie I watched ❤️. . and their careers... like kaleo.... way down they go . an ideal waste of robbery aplenty... . in reverse... lol... a crockery.... lol . La banda sonora es un solemne plagio de la compuesta por Ennio Morricone para la Misión de Roland Joffé . This is a wonderful film. . Imagine all these royals were Black... 🤔 . turns 25! . Big cast of Robert Downey  Jr.  Sam Neill  Ian McKellen  Hugh Grant  Ian McDiarmid  Meg Ryan  and David Thewlis. . The costumes and the art direction are spot-on. They got every detail of the 17th century with the outfits  the architecture  the gold colors of furniture  jewelry  and wealth.  . Goes on longer than it should but it's a gorgeous looking film with magnificent colors and elegant music.  . Everyone gives it their all. . I love how they used to do the cheesy narration in the movie trailers in the 90’s and it was always the same two dudes. It always seemed to start with “in a land” or “in a world” 😂😂😂 . ""Restoration"" has a wonderful soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard. Who had the bizarre idea of using Morricone's The Mission [btw also wonderful] here? 👀👀👀 . I remember watching this when i was in third grade . Didnt understand a thing. Well gonna watch it one more time . We reviewed this for our Hugh Grant podcast called 'Taking Hugh for Granted'  look it up and check it out if you're interested! We talk about this bizarre film  Hugh's role in it and his potential spats with Robert Downey Jr and Sir Ian McKellen! . So this movie is real!? . I had a vague memory about it  but I thought it was a parody or some sort. . Loved 👍😍🤩🏆😎❤💋🎬🥰👈👌💋❤❤😎❤iron man robert Downey jr. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😎❤😎🏆🤩😍👍 . No wonder the film failed at the box office... The trailer is pathetic. I remember enjoying watching it  though. . Why have I never heard of this movie?? . This king (Charles II)  is known as the biggest womanizer in Royal history . Are there any other movies other than this from the 80's 90's or 2000 . This video should have an age restriction . I have now ordered the film. Because Robert is playing with it.❤ . why do they show so much nudity in Hollywood movies...? could never understand... . I have fallen in love with my wife...RDJ is romance...... . Not as good as Horrible Histories . One of my favourite movies! This trailer  while full of nostalgia  doesn't do the movie justice. Both the movie and novel it is based on are amazing. This was one of Robert Downey's best performances. The cast is also amazing  they didn't show Ian McKellen and Ian McDiarmid...aka Gandalf name and Palpatine... . I'm seeing an awful lot of RDJ in this trailer. Like  a lot. . This looks awful.  This trailer leaves me feeling peculiar. . So... Wow. Don't know if I should watch this movie . There must always be a Stark in Winterfell . Does anyone know the name of the music in the begin? . 'In a world...' . I almost threw up 🤢 . American actors on british accent. Cool! . RDJ  Meg Ryan and Hugh Grant? Why have I never seen this before?? . Oh right  RDJ was an actor. . oh  look at Wolsey from The Thudors xDDDDDD. . Terrific film! .

Still better than the new one...plus they are in  the actual game for a reason. Thank you Mk11 . The movie that made my movie . We need more from Bridgette Wilson! . If you were there for this initial trailer  you're a real one. . Still better than the remake. . This was and still is better than new MK . 4 kano 333-333-333 . Like phrases . Love this one better u can’t run from me I don’t need to run . There world is ours . You can’t run from me I don’t need to run scorpion sub cero your soul is mine . Awesome. . I want to learn that awesome MOVE where Subzero appears to be doing a back handspring layout but holds it mid-air. . Fun fact: besides that this movie came out in 1995 the game Tekken came out as well and 15 years later the actor who played Shang Tsung also played in the Tekken movie. . this is just Mortal Kombat in name only. the more I rewatch this one  the more I've decided to declare that this is a lame adaptation. although  it's fun to watch  the problems still remain. PG-13  cheesy effects  sloppy fight scenes  and no gore. Johnny Cage  Shang Tsung  and Kano were spot on  the only 3 good fights were Liu Kang against the monk  Johnny Cage against Scorpion  and Liu Kang against Reptile. other than that  it's just not that good of a movie. the 2021 movie did R-rated justice and is 10x better than this Nickelodeon sitcom . У меня была кассета на видике . Ya .  .  .  .  .  . P . PG-13 wasn't even Mature enough . 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 . 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  Oh man watching this classic masterpiece in 2021. . I love this movie . I have Mortal Kombat 1995 and Mortal Kombat 2021 on Blu Ray . The actor of shang tsung is excelent for this representation . Better than the 2021 production. . Still the best Mortal Kombat movie for me. And it doesn't have any gore which to me is a good thing. . Mortal Kombat 2021 gets -1000 points for Cole Young . Please bring back the original theme tune in the new movies! It made the whole film  some things should be left as they were . Eai meu Tudo bem . This film is the best Mortal Kombat  even in 2021.... . As a kid back then and as an adult today  the best part of the Original MK Movie trailer were the character introductions. Gave me goosebumps back then  still does now. . This trailer is way better than the 2021 version . Damn  this trailer STILL gives me goosebumps! . So glad I grew up in this era :) . yea the special effect was never great and they look worst now  but what a great casting and and  the music so good they transfer it to the game  a great B movie . La mejor película del mundo . Liu kang: YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME SHANG! . shang tsung: I DON'T NEED TO RUN! . 0:34 itu Candi Prambanan bukan? . my childhood movie and in my opinion Kelly Hu shouldve been the right person  to play Kitana not Talisa Soto. Soto is hispanic and Kitana wasnt hispanic in the MK video game she was asian.  Soto is a good actress but i feel Hu shouldve been the right asian-american actress to play Kitana . I remember this being a preview for Dumb and Dumber on VHS. . The best film . Cristofer es un attor maravilloso en mortal kombat movie . At least the fight scenes and the soundtrack are alright. . watching it in 2021 . why they put ""the crow"" music in this trailer? . 2021 . After watching mortal Kombat 2021 this trailer is on another level . This movie is so much better than the new one . This Trailer was Avengers End Game level of excitement for 90's teens going to see it at the Cinema . Hands down the best video game adaption movie ever to be made . Did goro die too easily  . He looks too formidable 4 that to b the case . Iconic Shang Tsung  Raiden  and Liu Kang for me. And of course  the theme song! [Edited Raiden from Rayden. Oof!] . Ah  i remember seeing this trailer on our vhs of dumb and dumber. My sister wanted it and after we watched this we were given mortal kombat trilogy for the n64. . Film 2021 GAVNO👎 1995 👍 Shan samSUNG LEGENDARY ACTOR. Soundtrack FOreve🤘 . Cast was good a good movie of that era. . Just came to watch this after seeing the new movie . Can't believe they didn't use the clip of Sonya saying ""a handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world?"" . This is still better than Mortal Kombat 2021 . Am I watching Indian movie ?? . Mortal Kombat '95 vs Mortal Kombat '21  .  . **BEGIN** .  . Mortal Kombat '95 bows over the corpse of Mortal Kombat '21  .  . **FLAWLESS VICTORY** . Practical effects. A low-key heavy accent Asian lead. Charismatic actors. Real fights and stunts. Catchy music. No wonder this made kids and adults alike cheer and jump out of their seats. No heavy drama like the 2021  with Cole’s cookie cutter family as some sort of “plot”. . You must admit it  this trailer was just plain awesome . The Best mortal kombat in all existence . I remember the first time I saw this trailer in cinemas. When Scorpion and Sub Zero first entered  I knew the movie was going to break the video game movie curse. . Cant beat the original  the new 2021 version had potential and ruined it  tried too hard with silly Kano jokes  no MK audio  just didn't feel it. . Now to this day  the badass theme song still rocks and every time when we hear this theme playing in the backgrounds of the video games that we know and love plus this film rocks oh one more thing MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!! . Still better than the 2021 version. . This is and will always be the real world of Mortal kombat... This epic movie is still the best in 2021 and completely beats the new one Mortal kombat 2021... . ALARM :    DAS HIER IST  10.000 mal besser als die neuer verison  - guck nicht die neue version !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! . Oh look there's actually tournament in this one . Old school rules again  hail Mortal Kombat original 👌🏻 . Ordered this the old school way on the Jerrold and filmed it with the over the shoulder vhs camera back in the day. The only good Mortal Kombat movie. . As the new movie just came out  I was considering if I should check out the older version. But no. That stupidity is just ridiculous. Trailer is enough for me. I hope the new version is better. . badass movie . Damn this trailer still slaps!! . The best fighting music in the universe . This movie was better than the new one will always be. Remember watching it as a kid been a long time. . As impressive and classic as this one is. I can’t help but love the new one so much more. Like I got so pumped throughout it. I swear my adrenaline was out of control . even now i think this trailer is great. . Fun fact:  the ""You can't run from me  Shang!"" and ""I don't *need!* to run"" exchange isn't in the movie. . I love this trailer . Fast forward to 0:57 for pure bliss . Esse é o verdadeiro filme! . You would think after 26 years they would make a MK movie so great that it would cause a near Fatality...Disappointing fail  but I won't comment on everything that could've been done much better  because that would be a short story by itself. If they could combine this original with the technology and lack of reserve they used in the new remake  it would be one of the greatest movies of our time...I didn't hate the new movie  but had to go watch this the next day to appreciate MK more again...Hopefully the sequel will impress... . New is not like that no story  . Just a normal movie but old is gold 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 . Old is gold . Ahh...the good old days 😊 . Kano🎶lui kang🎶rayden🎶 . 1:20. Gets me all the time in the song .  its  like vogueing . Better movie than 2021 remake !Period . They cuda make the new one better than this... What a damn shame. . Christopher Lamber's charisma here as Raiden and that puppet in the MK2021 movie. After 26 years  aren't the movies supposed to be better? .  . After the Mortal Kombat 2021 disaster  I came back here  to re-appreciate this one-of-a-kind experience. Sub-Zero and Keno are the only things that the new movie did right. The rest is a total mess. But this  MK95  still manages to give me the chills even after 26 years and that's all that matters. . BEST....TRAILER....EVER! . much better than 2021 version . imagine going into this movie  thinking you'd only get the character set from MK1 and seeing Reptile and Kitana also make an appearance . The whole movie is so 90s  it hurts . Oh my god  that's Jim Cummings narrating the trailer. . La mejor no como la porqueria nueva! . YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME SHANG! . New one better"

This is pretty much the Pamela Smart story.  Nicole did NOT deserve an Oscar for The Hours.  That was bull. . Nicole Kidman won a golden globe for her performance in To Die For why was she nominated for an oscar? She finally won an oscar in the hours in 2003 she was overdue for one anyways! She was great in this flim since it was based on the Pamela Smart case**** . Joaquin Phoenix 2 years after his bro death starting to show us how talented actor is  like his late bro River...! Good movie with great actors. . Would've been fitting justice  if 3 other lives hadn't been destroyed in the process . now sound on this video. . I agree  that she should have won an Oscar  this was a great movie and I love the way she played her role  its was fantastic. she was so hot  without getting totally nude. Just her expression was what made it work. . this was her best movie and got her well known in the states . It's such a bummer the audio is muted. I really want to hear her say ""tomorrow it's going to be HOT"" when she tosses the sun on the weather map. Van Sant said that wasn't planned. . in this role she is really hot   however is great performance  .  . Well  i  first  saw  her  in  this  and  i was in  the  UK  at  the  time  thanks  for  the  reply! . American film debut? The first one was Days Of Thunder in 1990. . oh  yes! well  said  she's  a  total  sociopath  in this  one  and  does  a  great  performance i  believe  it's  KIDMAN'S  American  film  debut  and  you  see  a  young  JOAQUIN  PHOENIX  in  this  as   well!! . she plays a role of a narcissic pervert very crazy  scaring and good interpretation  . She's even prettier in practical magic . the story this is based off happened at the school i go to . pretty much .  . Nicole Kidman looks so fabulous :)) . Am I the only one who thinks that Matt Dillon and Joaquin Phoenix kinda look alike? . I just saw this recently  it's a gem. Joaquin and Casey <3 . nicole kidman was soo sexy in this film . omg joaquin!!! . This really did happen check out the Pam Smart story that's what this was based on. . Matt Dillon <3 .  . @SuperJayZFan1 Yeah it is  and I´m serious . I LOVE THIS MOVIE NICOLE KIDMAN IS SO HOT IN THIS MOVIE :) . this is the Nicole Kidman i love :""> . Joaquin Phoenix =) . she's so damned good looking in this role.  . nicole kidman is such a babe! . Kidman should have at least been nominated for an oscar for this role. She won several major awards from the critics  a golden globe and was nominated for a British academy award. I think hollywood thought she hadnt paid her dues so to speak  that she had married a hollywood superstar and had had it too easy. . Nicole Kidman's greatest role. . just watched this on E! tonight for the first time in a long time. what a great movie! nicole is fantastic in it. she deserved an oscar. joaquin got my blood boiling  too... i forgot just how much i love him. sooo sexy! lol... . Love this movie. Nic is so mean in it! haha So the oposite of what she's like in real life. She's the BEST ♥"

The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Keyser Söze?

I guess you could say he was playing mind games and his motive was to spread fear and let the people know he was behind it but then the whole point of his operation was so no one could recognize him (which he failed in seeing that the Hungarian and now the detective know his face). . โอเค 👌 .

When he found the power to express what was in his heart, he found the love of a lifetime.

Mario (Oscar® nominee Massimo Troisi in his final screen performance) is a newly appointed mailman who is madly in love with the most beautiful woman in town, Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). Bumbling, interminably shy and far too nervous to tell her how he feels, Mario becomes inspired when a world-famous Chilean poet visits the small island community. Pablo Neruda (Award winning actor Philippe Noiret, Cinema Paradiso) is a revelation to the otherwise introverted and soft spoken Mario and with his expert help Mario not only finds the right words to woo Beatrice but has a fighting chance to win her over.",PT1M54S,41675,105,2,0,3,Hello my dear old friend     .  .

60,jY56N6irNCk,Eye for an Eye (1996) Trailer,"An excellent movie! Kiefer is really creepy, but great.",PT56S,230840,206,17,0,98,"Hi guys... Full movie please. I love Keifer S. Best known in the Vanishing... Phonebooth.. STAND by me... The lost boat... LAST night... MANY. I love him Keifer congrats on your Hollywood star walk of fame. Much respect... I LOVE YOU FROM RSA . I liked this movie but still having problems watching it. . Love keifer in dis role great bad guy  . Loved loved the ending  . Watch ""I Spit on your grave""   The story is a bit like this one  But you get more than expected   its all very clearly (This movie too)   But... It's crude and horrorfying . But still a better movie ;D.  . P.S. : Sorry for my English   Im Dutch  And only 12 Years so...      . Yes  do the math. You can  can't you? . And why did he? Because she lured him so she could kill him. This was never about her defending herself. . Because this movie is seeing the wolf through the villagers point of view  a monster  as opposed to a person who is mentally ill. .  .  . do the math? how bout the fact that we conversed  for an hour and a bit  with your comments magically rising in likes. almost like you keep coming back.  the story isnt about hunting down anyone  the fact he comes after her at the end should signify that. the werewolf is the evil located in us all  thats why the person who becomes the werewolf generally doesn't know they are a wolf. kiefer represents something totally different. werewolf movies are about coming together. this movie was not.  .  . In 5 years about 170 000 people have watched this video. Do the math. . When I say werewolf stories  I don't mean stories about werewolves  it's a metaphor for stories were the moral is people should hunter down and kill the monsters they see. . Yeah  a spiteful assault.  . lol ya because in the last hour one person came read your comment and thumbed it up. whatever. werewolf movies arent a sub genre of revenge movies . they belong to a monster horrors  even more specific classical horror  along with the mummy and the swap thing. revenge: the action of inflicting hurt or harm on someone for a wrong suffered at their hands. keep thumbing your own comments up  it makes no difference to the fact that im right. . I don't think people care that much about commenting on this video  that doesn't mean they don't read the comments. If you don't want to believe this is my only account  then don't  I don't give a shit. . Revenge is not standing up for yourself (defending)  it's just spiteful assault. . Yes  and a subgenre of that subgenre are what I call werewolf movies. The difference being the moral of the story advocating such an action. . lol considering the last comment beside ours was 2 weeks ago.....i dont think people care that much about our conversation  so yes stop thumbing comments up with other accounts. yes she was standing  up for herself and her family. not only did he make her daughter a victim  he made the whole family a victim. she lured him on to her property hardly a lynch mob. you ve never seen taken. there is a sub genre of movies dedicated to avenging the death of a child. Christ. good day. learn movies. . Predatory rape and murder  yes. . She wasn't standing up for herself  she was intent on revenge for her daughter  and to stop this wolf doing it again. . I've never seen Taken  but I doubt it's as simplistic and unsubtle as this movie is. . Yeah... I only have one YouTube account. . rape then murder rarely  happens? the moral of the story is to stand up for yourself. its not just about protecting the future generations  the main character needed to get her life back. the werewolf is far far too simplistic. the werewolf doesnt represent evil  it represents fear. another huge difference. if you notice  the towns folk dont seem to intent on getting the wolf as you put it either. by your logic any taken is a were wolf movie too. thumbing up your own comments?? pathetic.  . Yes  a very specific real life issue that almost never happens. . The morale of this story is people should hunter down and kill the evil that exists in this world (the wolf)  to protect the women and children. Now if that isn't the old werewolf story  then I don't know what is. . not at all. first of all it addresses real life issues that are still  believe it or not  on going to this day. Sutherland's character represents for the second time now  the evil that exists in this world  that is seemingly untouchable. the only reason the evil was stopped  was because sally field  the good guy  the audience if you will  stood up and did something. a werewolf story? not even close.  . Two stars because it's essentially nothing more than a modern day werewolf story.  . excuse me  but if the cast and director are a list  the movie is a list. the movie was very realistic. it had elements of real life. the meetings the feeling of being hopeless  because the justice system is corrupt  who knew? the button pusher  im assuming you mean Sutherland  is the figure head for what we hate and what is destroying our society even to this day. he is the bad that never seems to get his  until the prey fights back. two stars simply because of a personal vendetta? pfff  . I loved this movie :D Kiefer was very convincing in this role . Alguém tem esse filme completo? .  . Ed Harris is such a girl in this movie! Sally Field is awesome in any movie! . download it  takes 3 mins! . It´s me  or kiefer in Eye for an eye seems James Hetfield?? . A B movie that somehow won the lottery and got an A-movie cast and director. The  premise was interesting and the characters felt very realistic  but the movie didn't  it didn't fairly question it's premise as much as dictate it. This blatant button-pusher plays upon our most primal emotions as well as the increasing disdain for the criminal justice system  it's just a terribly crude and bias movie that operates as propaganda for capital punishment and vigilantism. 2 stars. . I just Want to know where i can find this movie . yes u work out in mcdonalds 5 days a week :)  . also im english bet u dont even no the difference between being british and being english lol .u dumb dumb  . Esse filme é otimo .  . by the way dipshit i no ur comment  was not directed at me but reading comments  to see if it was a good film i see ur shit . . now i no a guy gets killed  the end so as the film goes on and i see some one brake in a house im gona no the dude gets killed .so u are a troll . . I love this movie  I have it on DVD. Many people dismiss it as a ""man-hating"" sappy Lifetime drama. I bed to differ; albeit a bit predictable at times  it is a constant edge-of-your-seat crime thriller. I myself am a criminal justice graduate heading on to pre-law education. This movie both confirmed and motivated my passion for criminal law and bringing offenders to justice in a professional  rigorous  and expedient manner. Excellent film  you won't be disappointed. . At the beginning of the movie when Sally runs into the younger daughter's bedroom  you can see the camera guy's reflection in the mirror. Whoopsie. . This movie was very messed up  the part with her daughter getting killed was hard to watch. . forgive me for being sensitive to such a heinous crime. I'll try and learn to laugh at girls and women being brutally raped.  . Watch Mystic River for the flip side to vigilantism. Kingsnake  you are supposed to dislike the rapist  not like his lines. . ""She was a great ffffuck."" favorite line from Kiefer. . @lkshaw1 i saw that last night too. you probably live in vegas. . This movie came on late last night . @Fanofcartoons1994 what the-? . this movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved it because for one thing it has sally fields in it and she has got to be the most amazing actresses in the world. Just the whole plot of this movie was awesome. I give it 5 stars .:D and 2 thumbs up. :DDDD <3 . Kiefer looks like James Hetfield (Metallica) in this movie. . @orlandobabe   .   . right!!!?? I'm a guy and I was fucking bawling I swear!  . I like this movie for several reasons: two being the cast and the story-I like revenge or vigilante storylines  seeing Sally Field play a role like this was incredible  Kiefer S. was very convincing as a sadistic villian...again. When justice fails  then what do you do? I'm not advocating or condoning what Sally did for real life  but in a movie  it's easier to condone it. I'm hoping the system wouldn't fail this badly in real life. . @HermonieG1 He probbaly just headed butted them right back x) ""head on. Apply directly to the FOREHEAD!"" He must've been real scary in the movie. . I fucking love this movie. . watching this movie made me cry lol :P . i coudn't ever find Kiefer scary. he's much too hot! . Great idea for a movie and a great cast but i thought it was a terrible movie. For a movie that was released in the theater  it sure felt like I was watching Lifetime.  And to those begging for a Youtube upload  please just pay $7.99/mo for Netflix. It's totally worth it! . @70sMiLA I saw the rape scene and I couldn't watch it again  believe me it is hard to watch that without your stomach turning. . such a bad trailer for such a BRILLIANT MOVIE . kiefer is awesome  . Man Kiefer was a damn good badass in this movie . I noticed a""blooper"" or ""mistake"" in the movie  while I was watching it. For anyone who has seen it  you'll know what I'm talking about. In the very beginning  when Sally's Character is doing her makeup  and then Ed's character messes it up with the shaving foam  as the camera zooms in  you can see it in the makeup mirror. . Just thought I'd share it! . Great film  a must see! . WHO KNOWS WHAT THE SONG IS CALLED WHEN KIEFER IS WATCHING TV AND IS DRUMMING ON HIS LEGS??? HELP!!  . Kiefer is awesome! Some parts of this are hard to watch to be honest but Kiefer just knocked the whole psycho rapist role out of the park . The whole cast was amazing in this movie  but Kiefer turned in one of his best pre-24 performances.  . Anyone please upload this movie........... i really want to see this because this is original. . I have seen remake of this movie in hindi. I loved that too...  . Oh God that murder scene in too horrifying..!  in both movies  .  . you can see similar scene  from that movie here . youtube.com/watch?v=ZrMWMs2Dxkg . @70sMiLA  ""Why hasn't anyone uploaded this whole movie on youtube yet""?? I've only been able to watch it once since it first came on because the scene with Kiefer Sutherland and Olivia Burnette is so horrific and much too graphic for me. The critics and viewers had a field day  saying the exact same thing  don't know how in the world Olivia pulled that scene off. Everytime I think of it it really deeply saddens me  and fills me with anger even I can't imagine. . awesome film i love watching it . That rape murder scene still haunts me.  .  . It's similar to Enough. . @Sicksoullleee haha i saw this movie for the first time today and that was exactly what i was thinking! . Wait why is it R . when i sow the trailer on tv for 1 sec i thought kiefer was james hetfield and i was about wtf?!?! :P . @15katevvet yea i know how that is . I saw the whole movie on youtube but that person took it off  who knows .. But I saw it for the first time on Lifetime   I'm warning ya .. that first scene is quite disturbing .. had an impact on me .. just creepy how you could be planning a party and the next your dead .. it was a good movie overall .. Sally Field was excellent .. Keifer was soo creepy   great job .  But it was a little hard to watch that scene   not gunna lie . this was an awesome movie. I was about the same age as the girl in the movie ( the victim) and the rape scene was graphically real even I was scared to be home alone for a while after that movie :( . If this was a Dirty Harry movie  you could bet that Kiefer's character would have had his creepy ass blown away by Clint... . Have only been able to watch this movie once  as the rape scenes are much too realistic and horrifying to watch (at least they were for me). . @SparksDrinker .....(o_o)....um no  I lack a certain thing in order to do that. . When Julie answers the door that's not in the movie. Did they just do that for the trailer to disguise what was to follow in the actual film? The brutal rape. . i fill bad for that  17 year old she die she got killed buy a grown man she iz so so so scared when he was triyin to put it i9nbut i can tell thasz fake because cusz it showed her pantansz when he pulled her up to hisz dick that was so so so so fucken gross . @70sMiLA Because that would be illegal  spend a couple bucks like a normal person if you want to see it. . Rapists and killers deserve no compassion  in my opinion. As for the revenge storyline  I like the genre  no matter how cliched it may get.    . The movie is very well done  the cast  esp.  . I'm not an advocate for taking the law in your own hands  but if justice fails  then what do you do? I can't condone failure of justice anymore than murder or rape. Plus I refuse to condemn what Sally Field does in the end  because justice did fail miserably  her and her daughter and I hope real justice works. . Next time you watch it  look in the little sister's dresser mirror when Sally Field runs into her bedroom (first minute of the movie). You can see the cameraperson in it. Kinda wrecked it for me for awhile. But it was a good movie. The attack scenes were hard to watch though. . This movie is ok but really inaccurate.  After the second woman he killed there wouldn't be any doubt as to his guilt in real life. . Next time you watch it  keep your eye on the mirror in the little girl's bedroom when Sally Field runs in there (opening minute of the film). You can see a crew member in a red shirt. Whoops! . Such a great movie!! . it's Shining road by Cranes :) . im looking for the song 2  :( . oh please  can someone upload this movie?  . i never had the chance to watch it  but i heard it's great:) . Kiefer always had that fuckin' great voice?! Damn. Even when he was like 20. . just to let browneyednessagirl93 u can get this dvd in WH SMITH  for around £12 . When Sutherland's character says ""Ssssorry"" a long Sorry was he like making fun of her daughter because at the beginning she did stutter a bit  and Sutherland never did it after that. .  . Also Sally Field did seem to get over her daughter's death a little quick I think it would have been a little better it they would have skipped ahead 2 months maybe. . Truly one of the best movies that Kiefer Sutherland ever did.  .   . Kiefer rocks!!! . Any1 know where to find this movie??? I can't find it newhere! . kief  is good plaing bad is so sexy he is a excelent actor***** . dude I just watched that movie and I fu***** hate that guy so much. I fealt so sorry for that girl in the beggining of the movie :( . seriously - it shows what an amazing actor he is  he's sooo creepily believable!"
61,JYoWGIrXiz0,"Richard Dreyfuss in ""Mr Hollands Opus"" 1996 Movie Trailer","When we're young our dreams lie out in front of us, there for the taking, and our plans seem so clear. But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. 

A musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. 

Redefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Official Trailer #1

""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your Juice in the Hood"" is a parody of a lot of black U.S. movies, for instance ""Boyz n the Hood"", ""South Central"", ""Menace II Society"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Juice"". We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.

My guess off 1000s of these turkeys... Chris McDonald is the weasle lol Cindy lost her Razzie to It's Pat actress Sweeny. It's supposed to be a true representation of the novel... the same one Stallone paid to skim for Cobra. . Being a lawyer in the 90s was as desirable as being in tech today.. . I wonder?... Is there terrible acting? Five too many unnecessary action scenes? Do they live? Do they figure out who the killer is? Do they fall in love? I’m guessing yes to everything. . Underrated movie  decent action  eye candy for both sexes  what more could you ask for from this type of movie? . 1:17 You see that hot chick? She was a badass in Aliens. . A Silver Pictures . Stupid but good. . The movie was much more than just a gorgeous face. Her acting was surprisingly ok. The move is quite underrated. I give the movie a well-deserved 6.4 out of 10. Which is not bad considering most movies today I barely give a 3 out of 10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🎥 . One of the actors I can't get enough of. . I love this!!🤷‍♀️ . Loved watching it....again  I think .

Cobra was better. . thanks for the reminder bonfire. crackle crackle . I gotta say - this doesn’t look that bad! I might have to hunt for a DVD. 😁 . Cindy Crawford 😍 . He looks like nathan drake of uncharted . Kate (Crawford) was singled out between the good guys and bad guys and handed a tough part. I bought the DVD and play it from time to time. What's so weird is this trailer. Many of the scenes shown here never made it to the real film. . these 90s movies may are crap  but i prefer them much more than the crap from nowadays...what happened to Holllywood?? anyone can explain? . pow powwww powwwwwwwww . underrated movie weigh higher than 13% on rotten tomatoes . Weird that this movie and ""Cobra"" 1986 - are based off the same book... .  . One movie is delightful 80s shit. .  .

I never hear it being mentioned when people talk about the romances from the 90s.  I remember seeing a trailer for it when I was a teen and finally watched it on cable tv a couple years later.  It was a lovely film and now that I own it  I'll definitely watch it more often.  It's a shame they don't make movies like this anymore. .  . Also  who would love to have a great friend like Kim in their life?  She's very encouraging & supportive and truly cares about Lisa enough to tell her when she's being ridiculous. lol . Anyone knows exactly where did the shooting of this flim take place ? . I love this movie. . Bed of roses  Some kind of Wonderful  True romance Heathers and thing with Christian Slater.👍 . My mom took me to see this when I was 12. I only remember the song. Definitely need to revisit this movie. . I really liked this movie as a 90s tween. I thought it was really romantic in my innocent brain. I showed it to my family and they all made fun of it. Hurt my feelings a lot lol . Seems like a corny movie but I do love 80s and 90s movies where they incorporate so much of NYC into it. . Love you forever  Christian. And I hope to God I can one day put a camera on you and let you do your craft while playing the lead in a movie i wrote and directed!!!!!!! . Can someone upload it please . I would give up everything to relive the 90's . Times were so much better in the late 90's . I.liked this movie . Yes he would be considered a creep now and days . Twelve years and no one has said it? Alright  I’ll leave the comment. .  .  . Dammit Bobby! . What’s the first music call? . I remember they showed this trailer in front of Jumanji (1995) on theatres. I was 6 years old at the time! Mannn I miss the 90s!! . Before independent love song . Please tell me what music is this? . But wait- isn't J.D. dead? . One of my all time favs :) . La vi en el cine pero no la puedo conseguir quiero verla otra vez . What's the name of the song towards the end? . To this day  Christian Slater is one of my acting idols. I used to dress like his character from True Romance when i was in my teens! . One romantic movie i cried for first time watching i was 15 and the movie was shown on tv in my country in 2004. The ending part just.... so touching . I love this movie I wish it was available to buy digitally on one of the streaming sites. . You can’t watch this online anywhere!!! It’s one of my favs! . You need this awesome movie!!!!!!!!   https://www.ebay.com/itm/224198229614 .

The music in this trailer 😩😍 . Where I can watch this movie? Or a link. . Thank you! . This is the most 90's trailer I've ever seen . This is such underrated romantic movie . He's gorgeous. Loved him in untamed hearts . I love this movie  saw it in theaters by myself and became romanced by the whole thing. It was one lonely person connecting to another lonely person. They don't make romantic films like these anymore. . This movie pissed me off. Trailer too. Lots of deleted scenes show up in the trailer ugh.  . MSM character was cold  manipulating and boring. . This and only you. Best rom coms ever . The best movie! Beautiful love story ever!🌹🌹🌹😍 I need somebody like Louis... . Beautiful . Storms In Africa - Enya (Beginning trailer song)  Such a beautiful song! . I was a very Handsome Bastard wasn't I??? . Dear friends . This song is called ""independent love Song"" -Scarlet. . I remember this trailer on television when it first aired in theaters.. 😂😂😂 it was a good movie....I had a crush on Mary Stuart Masterson....👍 . Ugh why don't guys like this exist?!! . Fantastic movie! . Simply my favorite love movie of all times. Death against love. Time against reason. One sensitive man. One good girl. This film is at least for both men and women's. I like nothing about so called romantic films of today. They all suck. . Nice movie . I haven't seen this movie in years  I've always loved it. But wow....that is my life right now. . this move make me cry . My favorite movie in the 90s.  I still have the VHS. 🙈 . I was in the Marines and I CRY every time I watch the end of this film ...  *DAMMIT* !!! . I like this movie  but yes this trailer pretty much is the sum of the film.... . Two likable stars in only a fair movie.  Really  if you watch the trailer here  you've SEEN the movie. The actors are the best things in it. . This movie ranks as the Best Love Story ever! . I would die to see it again. Any help? I love it!!! . Best Movie in the World Bar None It is my favorite . I watch this movie two or three times a year. It's one of my ""late night"" movies when I wake up and can't get back to sleep. I can practically recite this movie. Is that bad? I would never tell anyone that out loud. . A TRULY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE THAT BRINGS JOY AND HOPE TO US ALL . . Love this instrumental version of the song. Wish I could get this version . Oh wow! I remember this movie. Just finished watching parts of (couldn't make it all the way through) Slater's Playback  and I wanted to come and cleanse my mental palate with something from when he was a charming screen idol. . Thank you!  I would never thought about sharing this movie with someone. . This is really pretty script  I think. Not much PC. Good time for Hollywood. . i fell in love with Mary Stewart Masterson because of this movie . Almost 20 years ago... omg!!! A beautiful movie with an unforgettable soundtrack. . never seen this yet i feel as though its the 100th time ive seen it . La película más romántica basada en un caso real  . A underrated movie . Amanda - it's Independent Love Song by Scarlet . Totally love this movie...and the soundtrack was a perfect fit. . find full movie here http://viooz.co/movies/7249-bed-of-roses-1996.html . where can I find this full movie that actually works?? I wanna see it!! :D . one of the most romanticmovies ever!!! i LOVE this movie . not if it's Slater :P  . Because this is a movie and unrealistic. . what's the name of the song in this trailer? . It actually would. Stalkerish and Sweet are determined by how the guy actually looks most of the time  unfortunately. Since it's Slater.. well... it looks sweet. . christian slater was sucha hot 90's hunk . no. personally i think thats really romantic. it would be stalkeresque if he watched her every night for a month and then sent her flowers along with a letter about what their future grandchildren would be named lol. or if he saw her somewhere else and followed her home. but just happening to see her through he window when he was out walking for his own purposes and sending her flowers because she was sad is really sweet and thoughtful. <3 . I disagree. Now  breaking into her house would be considered ""creepy"" and ""stalking."" . hey this trailer was shown in the Now and Then vhs previews when i saw this as a little kid! . just a woman wh owatch too much stephen king movies!normal woman would like that! . i think too many women hide their own insecurities behind ""stalker"" tags on guys who are genuinely interested and like the old fashioned way of try try again..  its become commonplace to throw away what you have for what you ASSUME is better  only to find out its worse and more full of crap than the first 90-100. . Yes if the guy was ugly and broke  what about Tom Cruize or Will Smith watching your window?LOL . This movie is YT for free in full.  . You'd need a mop to clean up the amount of sap that oozes from their trailer  and that's only a section of the film.  . In real life yes--but if she did'nt fall in love with him in this case there would be no storyline! LOL . Damn he was so fine back in the day. . But? . But. If you hurt her I'll KILL you. Okay? . @donlongluca but would you mind Christian slater as your stalker . LOVE this movie  Christian Slater is great in this. . @0406763552 the song is called ""Independent Love Song"" . @crazyrainbowlover   thts lyk askin ""why cant there b world peace?"" . Its called Independent Love Song by Scarlett at 1.25 ;0) x .  . I love that moment where they fall backwards on the stack of sterling roses  it is romantic and fits the title to a T. . one person is not lying in a bed of roses . @donlongluca  .  . Fear  fear and more fear... that is what moves America . I remember when this trailer played in theaters for well over 8 months and I don't recall it ever actually being in theaters. LOL . Flowers after just first sight? Normal? No it's not normal  it's just LOVE! . @donlongluca Yeah.  You're right man.  That's why there aren't men that act that way."

In conclusion  this doesn't try to be 'smart.' . Plus  Demi asks her onscreen son why he cut something out of the papers and he says that she told him to  and she says he 'never' helps her  which helps you like Terminator 2 'more.' This is the worst Demi film of 1996. . @perfection0x The way Demi treated him by calling him a cry-baby  I wanted to smack her HARD in the face. . this movie  make me so mad  i can not even express the emotion. .

It's a classic. Walken  Loyd  Garcia  Williams  Forsythe  Buscheme  Cobb  etc.  jesus......... . Agred  it's entertaining and these kids today will believe anything. . come on dude. I saw that you uploaded 3 or 4 scenes from the movie. You can't be serious... This is a kick ass movie. Pulp Fiction is a great movie too. We mustn't compare these 2 movies. Totally different stories. I can't find any similarities between these 2 . brooklyn jimmie flatbush ave best pizza and best buckwheats . Mr. shoosh is coming 2 give u big hot buckwheats . pulp fiction is an amazing movie  but it has nothing to do with this one... this is one o my fav movies  its full of memorable scenes and the dialogue is unforgettable . That ad in no way does justice to the film  it made it look atrocious. . I mean not directly opposed to your judgement of Pulp Fiction being a good movie. . I didn't mean to be insulting with the ""f***n****f***"". That was uncool. Just wanted to make a point.  . Else I think I'm correct  but not directly opposed to your judgement. Sorry for the wording. . Why do you compare two completely different things?  . This one's nothing like Pulp Fiction. This here stuff's about morals  and values  and integrity.  . Pulp Fiction is about incredible visuals and ""fuck-nigga-fuck-what-a-strange-and-wonderful-world"" kinda stuff. . Any one get the ending Ive seen it about five times me and my mates just argue ...there not dead are they it was just a guy telling a story and they got of with the money ? . AHAHAH they used cues from Black Rain for this trailer. . One of the most underrated films EVER!"

I will rocket you to the sky! . @eurydiceissonice That part wasn't in the movie either. . Wes Anderson's best offering.
